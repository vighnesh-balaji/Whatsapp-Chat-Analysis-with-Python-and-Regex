[3/29/22, 11:19:31 AM] ‪+91 98830 15080‬: What is the estimated cost of MSCS including living expenses?
[3/29/22, 11:19:31 AM] ‪+91 98830 15080‬: And how much amount should we show for financial support documentation?
[3/29/22, 11:20:05 AM] ‪+91 88531 45953‬: +1
[3/29/22, 11:41:12 AM] ‪+91 82798 03383‬: I have my undergraduate friend in MSCS Fall 21 class. He gave the following estimate:

1) Around 30K tuition fees for first two semesters and 18K tuition fees in 3rd semester

2) Around 1K per month rent if 4 people share the apartment (can be less if you bargain well with the owner). Around 500 USD per month for groceries and other food items
[3/29/22, 11:42:32 AM] Haya Columbia: So a total of approximately 78k in tuition fees?

[3/29/22, 11:43:25 AM] ‪+91 98830 15080‬: Tution fees increases every year by some %
[3/29/22, 11:43:43 AM] ‪+91 98830 15080‬: It should be around 82-85k for us then
[3/29/22, 11:44:18 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: As per University's website, total cost including tuition and living expenses of one year for MS in engineering programs is around 90k. For visa, it's advisable to show 1.-1.5 times this amount.
[3/29/22, 11:44:39 AM] Haya Columbia: Oh god!
It's like a challenge "which uni can make students bury themselves under more debt"
[3/29/22, 11:46:26 AM] ‪+91 98830 15080‬: We need to show that we can fund for 1st year only? What about 2nd year of masters. I thought we need to declare that we can fund the entire course.
[3/29/22, 11:46:55 AM] Haya Columbia: Aren't most full time masters courses at columbia only 3 sems for international students?
[3/29/22, 11:47:18 AM] ‪+91 99308 72145‬: Yes 1.5 years only
[3/29/22, 11:47:29 AM] Haya Columbia: Not even 1.5 just one
[3/29/22, 11:47:42 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Show around 1.5 times the i20 amount
[3/29/22, 11:47:42 AM] ‪+91 99308 72145‬: MS EE is 1.5
[3/29/22, 11:47:55 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: MSE is 1.5 too
[3/29/22, 11:48:03 AM] Haya Columbia: Im so confused now because there's conflicting info about this
[3/29/22, 11:48:09 AM] Haya Columbia: I'm MS EE too
[3/29/22, 11:48:37 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Isn't it specified on your department's website?
[3/29/22, 11:49:26 AM] Haya Columbia: I tried to find specific info but a lot of it is vague

[3/29/22, 11:50:47 AM] ‪+91 88531 45953‬: Can someone confirm how much we need to show if the fees is $81k for 3 sem course
[3/29/22, 11:51:11 AM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Only 1st year
[3/29/22, 11:51:39 AM] Haya Columbia: I'm making a list of questions I'm going to email the ISSO. 

I already spoke about this to a few other admitted students but if you guys want too, I'll make a shared doc online, we can agree on a deadline after which I'll email all questions on the sheet to the ISSO and post the answers back here.
[3/29/22, 11:51:56 AM] Haya Columbia: We can ask about fees, visa, min credit requirements, etc.
[3/29/22, 11:52:04 AM] ‪+91 88531 45953‬: Awrsome, thanks!
[3/29/22, 11:52:06 AM] ‪+91 99308 72145‬: Yes please do share it here!
[3/29/22, 11:53:12 AM] Haya Columbia: They'll put a number called the COA (cost of attendance) on your I-20 whatever that amount is, you have to show atleast that much.

So, if your tuition fees alone comes to 80k and living is another 30 k you'll have to show 100k minimum available funds
[3/29/22, 11:54:05 AM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: My counselor told they only care about first year's total expense
[3/29/22, 11:54:42 AM] Haya Columbia: Yes but if the degree is like 1.5 years (or anything more than one, but less than 2) then they'll ask for the whole thing
[3/29/22, 11:55:12 AM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: So u only need to show enough 2-3k usd more than first year's fees
[3/29/22, 11:55:37 AM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: U sure about that?
[3/29/22, 11:55:39 AM] ‪+91 88531 45953‬: You mean 20-30k?
[3/29/22, 11:56:14 AM] Haya Columbia: Plus living expenses and health insurance and stuff
[3/29/22, 11:56:35 AM] ‪+91 98196 66939‬: What would be the overall expense for 1.5 years?
[3/29/22, 11:56:38 AM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: First year's total expenses*
[3/29/22, 11:56:41 AM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Sorry my bad
[3/29/22, 11:57:12 AM] Haya Columbia: Well, if your i20 COA is 93k (random number from the top of my head) 
If you show 95k, yes, youve met the requirements. But if you show 110k, its even better.

[3/29/22, 11:58:09 AM] Haya Columbia: Basically the need for this is to prove to the immigration officer that you wont becime an unwelcome immigrant in the US by saying you dont have enough money to do what you cane for or leave
[3/29/22, 11:58:38 AM] Haya Columbia: Fair enough
[3/29/22, 11:58:40 AM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Yes obv. But we're talking about the min. Number
[3/29/22, 11:58:58 AM] Haya Columbia: Min number is the exact value on your i20 for the first year
[3/29/22, 11:59:25 AM] ‪+91 98117 01532‬: Even I've talked to a lot of people and they've all agreed that the amount required to show in the visa process is same as the I20 amount
[3/29/22, 11:59:39 AM] Haya Columbia: It says so on the state dept website too
[3/29/22, 12:00:00 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Which they only listed as estimated expenses. The reason we increase 2-3k usd is because in case of any sever currency value change between inr and usd
[3/29/22, 12:00:26 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: That's the actual min. Number

[3/29/22, 12:02:27 PM] Haya Columbia: Seems like!

Intl students need atleast 12 but can do part time for 3rd sem so lot of intl students do 12-12-6

[3/29/22, 12:06:42 PM] Haya Columbia: I'm still comparing choices before I get to i20
[3/29/22, 12:06:45 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Acha
[3/29/22, 12:07:33 PM] Haya Columbia: It didn't make sense to me to but the lady said there's some arrangement you can make with your dept. 

I'll add this question to my list
[3/29/22, 12:08:12 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: U can always accept multiple colleges ka i20s and later decide upon which one to confirm with
[3/29/22, 12:13:48 PM] ‪+91 88531 45953‬: Also, around what date/month are we supposed to show this amount?
[3/29/22, 12:17:36 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: 6k$ for insurance  
Fees around 2500$ per credit
[3/29/22, 12:18:02 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: Spoke to a senior 
He said that the amount on i20 is based on fee structure of current year
[3/29/22, 12:18:13 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: They bump it up by 8-10% every year
[3/29/22, 12:18:16 PM] Haya Columbia: But that does also mean paying thousands in deposits.
[3/29/22, 12:18:27 PM] Haya Columbia: 10% is typical
[3/29/22, 12:18:31 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: So by the time we start it'll be 2500 against 2271 mentioned
[3/29/22, 12:18:57 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: 6k insurance is for the first year
[3/29/22, 12:19:06 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: For the last 6 months another 3-3.5k
[3/29/22, 12:21:14 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: And for i20 one needs to show resources for funding the 1st year education
[3/29/22, 12:21:54 PM] Haya Columbia: Do your shopping for insurance btw.

The word insurance is synonymous with the word scam in the US 

If you can find a better service that columbia accepts, go for it. But it will take days, maybe weeks, of research
[3/29/22, 12:21:55 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: By this it'll be 2750 when we end first year
[3/29/22, 12:22:48 PM] ‪+91 99997 49690‬: That's a good idea
[3/29/22, 12:25:41 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: 👍🏻
[3/29/22, 12:27:56 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: Where do we search for insurance?
[3/29/22, 12:28:37 PM] Haya Columbia: Ask someone you know in the US who's been there for a substantial amount of time
[3/29/22, 12:28:41 PM] Haya Columbia: (Not a student)
[3/29/22, 12:41:38 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: And we need to ensure that the insurance is accepted by Columbia
[3/29/22, 12:42:24 PM] Haya Columbia: Yeah i mentioned😅

Do you guys agree?
[3/29/22, 1:23:40 PM] Disha Khanted Columbia: What are the other charges other than the tuition?
[3/29/22, 1:24:15 PM] Srishti Columbia: Sounds good.
[3/29/22, 1:24:26 PM] Haya Columbia: Intl student fees, rent and living expenses, insurance, a bunch of other fees to different departments at the uni
[3/29/22, 1:30:05 PM] Haya Columbia: Lol
Didn't think people could be shy on a google doc
Saw a whole bunch of people log in and leave but no one typed anything 😂

Check your dept webpage.
[3/29/22, 4:08:52 PM] ‪+91 82798 03383‬: Yes he is actually paying $750 per month with 4 people in his apartment so in total they are paying 3k for it but he told that it is little difficult to get it at $750, most of the people get it for somewhere between $900 to $1000
[3/29/22, 4:12:59 PM] ‪+91 80739 12982‬: Getting 700 dollars per month is possible if they stay in Queens and travel daily for 1 hour

We will not be having mandatory on-campus sessions that are out of alignment with Welcome Day and dept orientations. We will be a blend of virtual and on-campus offerings and they will align with the school's already communicated dates. So long as you follow those, you will be here for the sessions you require.

  

Best,

Gabby

Columbia does admit a lot of people for MS CS, but 1000 is probably too much.

[4/2/22, 9:59:54 PM] ‪+91 79958 98660‬: For MS CS, the acceptance rate might hover around 20%. This is similar to schools like UCSD, GaTech and UMass

If you go to this page and do some Maths on 2019 MS CS class response rate, turns out that strength at that time was around 200, so it should be around 250-300 now

Almost ~30% acceptance rate for grad engineering programs
[4/3/22, 11:43:56 AM] ‪+91 92056 75197‬: 8.5 GPA, plus decent projects and a similar internship, you are in
[4/3/22, 11:44:27 AM] ‪+91 92056 75197‬: Most cases
[4/3/22, 11:44:32 AM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: The point which you’re missing out on is inside one major there are multiple concentrations.
[4/3/22, 11:46:07 AM] ‪+91 92056 75197‬: I was rejected from Cornell, yale, Princeton with similar programs and concentrations but supposedly higher acceptance rates than Columbia.

[4/3/22, 11:46:35 AM] ‪+91 92056 75197‬: So yeah, Columbia is pretty much Cash cow

2. Understand that on weekends and after business hours I may not respond immediately, but I’ll try to chime in when possible. 
3. I’ll do my best to share info, answer questions, and dispel falsehoods. I also ask that you all continue to share the info you find. There’s a lot out there and you will all be a great resource for one another.

In case you go for a loan, check them out.  They basically take care of the entire loan process for you.  And since they're funded by the govt, they don't charge you anything
[4/9/22, 10:19:06 PM] ‪+91 94826 93409‬: They have tie ups with banks and negotiate on your behalf
[4/9/22, 10:30:28 PM] ‪+91 99997 69125‬: Thank you! This seems super helpful!
[4/9/22, 10:32:19 PM] ‪+91 94826 93409‬: I have a friend who used them and highly recommended it. They also have a YouTube channel if you wanna do the whole process yourself

[4/10/22, 1:00:54 AM] ‪+91 77589 11100‬: If we are in our final semester we have to wait till we get the grades of our last sem before sending the transcript right? Or can we send them now?

[4/10/22, 1:01:42 AM] ‪+91 98830 15080‬: Can't i mail it to them?
[4/10/22, 1:02:15 AM] ‪+91 77589 11100‬: No it has to be sent officially by your university either electronically or through post
[4/10/22, 1:02:16 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Ideally your transcripts should have the date of degree conferred and a copy of the degree certificate. 

But for now you can just send the current transcripts. They will put another remaining checklist for degree certificate in that case. You can send the final degree certificate till Oct 15
[4/10/22, 1:02:28 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: No, the registrar has to send

[4/10/22, 9:56:23 AM] ‪+91 82801 33261‬: There's some eligibility criteria mentioned on the website. If you meet those you need to get the booster dose.

[4/10/22, 9:57:40 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: The MMR one and the covid one
[4/10/22, 9:58:03 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: But there's a different link where four are mentioned

[4/10/22, 10:00:59 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: That you need it by August

[4/10/22, 10:29:16 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: Is it not at all possible to start your i20 without the UNI?
[4/10/22, 10:29:36 AM] Srishti Columbia: No
[4/10/22, 10:30:48 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: I read somewhere that it is possible to use your PIN to start the procedure
[4/10/22, 10:30:53 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: Do you know about it?
[4/10/22, 10:32:14 AM] Srishti Columbia: On the website of I20 details it does say something like that but as far as I know everyone is starting the i20 process with their UNI.

[4/10/22, 10:34:52 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: 👍
[4/10/22, 10:37:02 AM] ‪+91 82801 33261‬: The other two are meningitis and seasonal influenza. The site says we can decline vaccination for meningitis... we need to submit an online form( given on site) declining the vaccination. And regarding seasonal influenza, it says Columbia provides this vaccination free of cost. So, if we don't receive this vaccination we can take it there. So, it seems only MMR and COVID are important. Probably that is why only these are mentioned on the checklist
[4/10/22, 10:37:15 AM] ‪+91 6385 666 123‬: 👍🏼
[4/10/22, 10:37:44 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: Understood, thanks for the prompt clarification!

[4/11/22, 2:03:57 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Fall Sem starts on 6th September
[4/11/22, 2:04:10 PM] ‪+91 98993 66345‬: Perhaps the first week of August?
[4/11/22, 2:04:38 PM] ‪+91 91 6040 500 6‬: Damn wouldn't that be a little too early
[4/11/22, 2:04:44 PM] ‪+91 98993 66345‬: But the welcome day/orientation is on 26th August.
[4/11/22, 2:04:49 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: Do we need to be there a month before?
[4/11/22, 2:04:58 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Oh right
[4/11/22, 2:05:17 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: So Id say we’d land in US around 15th-20th August?
[4/11/22, 2:05:35 PM] ‪+91 91 6040 500 6‬: Is it for all the departments? I remember seeing August 30th for BME
[4/11/22, 2:05:44 PM] ‪+971 52 214 1773‬: Yeah I think landing 10 days prior to the welcome day should be good enough yea?
[4/11/22, 2:05:53 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp I think so too
[4/11/22, 2:06:35 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: Yes that seems good enough. So that we get time to settle down.
[4/11/22, 2:07:24 PM] ‪+91 98993 66345‬: Yeah. It should be anytime within 30 days before the orientation, I think.
[4/11/22, 2:07:55 PM] ‪+91 83178 65553‬: Btw what is the recommended dates for starting the i20 process on compass. My loan/fundings approval will still take around 2 weeks.
[4/11/22, 2:08:49 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: For I20 you will need to show proof of funding, which includes an approved loan letter. So as soon as you get that you should start your I20 process
[4/11/22, 2:08:51 PM] ‪+91 98193 54415‬: I think it’s 30 days before the start of term. So you can’t enter the US before Aug 6th
[4/11/22, 2:09:18 PM] ‪+91 98993 66345‬: It's whatever is going to be on the i20, I believe.

[4/11/22, 2:18:36 PM] ‪+91 98193 22020‬: Can we check for visa slots without filling the ds-169?
[4/11/22, 2:20:45 PM] ‪+91 95306 66033‬: No u gotta first fill in ds160 and then pay the fees on US visa site and then only u can book appointment.
[4/11/22, 2:30:45 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: On your I20 start of the term is gonna be the orientation day

[4/11/22, 2:36:53 PM] Rohit Columbia: One Mumbai US consulate guy told they will be adding more staff in June for interviews - so slots should not be an issue Ig. Also they are suspending re-interviews for rejected students from this year.

[4/11/22, 3:24:12 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: Is it only for the Mumbai consulate or for consulates across India?
[4/11/22, 3:24:18 PM] ‪+91 98830 15080‬: For what reasons do they reject a visa?
[4/11/22, 3:27:26 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: I think you can try 
But after like 6 months not sure
[4/11/22, 3:27:51 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: I have heard that you need to keep us clear that you intend to come back after your studies are over

[4/11/22, 3:29:48 PM] Rohit Columbia: Not sure about this :)

[4/11/22, 3:35:06 PM] ‪+91 77589 11100‬: This year onwards if you fail your visa interview once you can't apply again for the year
[4/11/22, 3:35:24 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: Columbia has one of the highest visa acceptance rates
[4/11/22, 3:36:06 PM] Rohit Columbia: not possible from this year ig
[4/11/22, 3:36:47 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: Are you sure?

If you get your visa rejected then you can’t apply again?
[4/11/22, 3:36:57 PM] ‪+91 79958 72808‬: How did you stumble upon that metric xD
[4/11/22, 3:37:02 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: Where did you get this information?
[4/11/22, 3:37:16 PM] Rohit Columbia: it was in the news a couple days back

[4/11/22, 3:43:39 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: We should remember that last year they gave more visas because many students had deferred their admissions from 2020 to 2021 due to the Pandemic
[4/11/22, 3:44:02 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: True
[4/11/22, 3:55:08 PM] ‪+91 90224 80254‬: Yup I've heard about this as well

[4/11/22, 7:46:22 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Your expire visa has to be F1
[4/11/22, 7:46:25 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: The website said this
[4/11/22, 7:46:35 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: I read that only the same *type* of visas are valid for Dropbox
[4/11/22, 7:46:42 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Ohhh
[4/11/22, 7:46:44 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: *expired
[4/11/22, 7:47:16 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Although yeah according to this maybe they may waive
[4/11/22, 7:47:20 PM] ‪+91 79958 72808‬: It says in the link if you were alloted any type of visa right
[4/11/22, 7:47:33 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah so maybe this is the new rule

[4/11/22, 7:52:24 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Hypothetically if we dont get a visa appointment until after orientation or 30days after program starts, does Columbia defer in these situations?
[4/11/22, 8:07:57 PM] ‪+91 99890 79286‬: On the offer letter it says they dont give deferrals but when someone asked this in the open house they said the admissions office might consider exceptions
[4/11/22, 8:08:15 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Thank you
[4/11/22, 8:09:19 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: *might*

[4/11/22, 8:13:23 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Although, I’d say this definitely would be an exception
[4/11/22, 8:13:39 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Cause this isn’t in our hands, right
[4/11/22, 8:14:00 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You can put the query on the main group
[4/11/22, 8:17:25 PM] ‪+91 99890 79286‬: Yeah better to check on main group or to mail admissions
[4/11/22, 9:12:11 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Just want to be aware of all the options haha😅😅😅
[4/11/22, 9:12:35 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Yeah might mail admissions
[4/11/22, 9:24:06 PM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: Does Dropbox mean getting a Visa without the interview?
[4/11/22, 9:24:17 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Yes
[4/11/22, 9:24:24 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yep
[4/11/22, 9:24:34 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: If you have any type of eligible visa you can use Dropbox
[4/11/22, 9:24:41 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: I’m planning to do the same
[4/11/22, 9:25:18 PM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: Even if the visa has expired now? What’s the procedure for applying for this?
[4/11/22, 9:25:34 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Is there an option to apply for Dropbox?
[4/11/22, 9:25:49 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: No not expired
[4/11/22, 9:26:08 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: But it has 10 years of validity

[4/11/22, 9:28:10 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah exactly they just say “previously issued”
[4/11/22, 9:28:38 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: But it’s obvious that it should be valid 🥲
[4/11/22, 9:29:12 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: We’ll not really, one of my family members applied for renewal of visa (although tourist visa) and didn’t have to give an interview

Depending on your answers, they will decide the eligibility for an interview waiver
[4/11/22, 10:10:47 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Ohh, thanks!

[4/12/22, 6:06:00 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: 🫠who?
[4/12/22, 6:06:07 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: This

[4/12/22, 6:06:34 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Then why was prodigy mentioning 87k
[4/12/22, 6:06:35 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: Are you sure we have to show 135k for VISA ?

[4/12/22, 6:06:57 PM] ‪+91 83178 65553‬: Dude I don’t think 3rd sem tuition will be 31k dollars.
[4/12/22, 6:07:08 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: It’s less
[4/12/22, 6:07:10 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Yeah thats not correct
[4/12/22, 6:07:20 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: But idk why uts 87k
[4/12/22, 6:07:26 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: It’s 14k

[4/12/22, 6:07:34 PM] ‪+91 83178 65553‬: I think it’s rather 15k since there will be only 6 credits for 3rd sem
[4/12/22, 6:07:43 PM] Rohit Columbia: For safety 
Otherwise how will you justify 3rd sem cost to consular officer
[4/12/22, 6:07:53 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: It's probably last year's figure or spring

[4/12/22, 6:15:23 PM] ‪+91 78763 67556‬: Isn't it that for visa we have to show the amount mentioned on our i-20 and on i 20 they only mention the cost of 1st academic year for the program..
[4/12/22, 6:15:37 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Yea for i20
[4/12/22, 6:15:51 PM] ‪+91 78763 67556‬: Is this 135 k figure mentioned anywhere on the website?
[4/12/22, 6:16:01 PM] ‪+91 73395 50659‬: 7.92% is APR or just interest rate?
[4/12/22, 6:16:03 PM] ‪+91 79809 16814‬: +1
[4/12/22, 6:16:29 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Nope

[4/12/22, 8:40:03 PM] Rohit Columbia: After about 2-3 days after payments, your details should be updated in the portal. 
So you could activate your uni before you get it in the email. But yeah, you will get the uni in your mail.

[4/12/22, 10:17:28 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: FDs are allowed as Long as you get a statement from the bank

[4/12/22, 10:20:56 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Don’t liquidate FD if it’s old one. Since you have better interest rate
[4/12/22, 10:21:52 PM] Rohit Columbia: Yep dont liquidate now 
For proof you do not have to break your fd if thats what you're planning to do
[4/12/22, 10:30:03 PM] ‪+91 90820 50695‬: Yeah I got my i-20 and I uploaded FD statements. but it did not have any statement indicating that it can be withdrawn at any moment.
[4/12/22, 10:34:48 PM] ‪+91 99635 36644‬: So even FDs with longer maturity dates like a year and above are accepted?
[4/12/22, 11:05:58 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: Asking another time to confirm: are loan sanction letters valid?

If you already have a WES evaluation you can send it
But if you don't, i think it'll be too expensive
[4/14/22, 10:46:21 AM] Vriddhi Columbia: Maybe request your registrar to send it electronically
[4/14/22, 10:59:23 AM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: What I did was, I asked Columbia to officially request transcript verification to my current Uni. 
Yesterday I received an email from my uni to submit my transcript by email to them and they will verify and send it to Columbia !

[4/14/22, 11:05:41 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It should be sent from your university. As long as it’s sent directly from your university they’ll accept it

[4/14/22, 1:35:31 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Like for eg. I’m a student of Pune University which comes under Govt of Maharashtra. So unless and until governor officially felicitates the degree, they cannot provide you one in advance

[4/14/22, 2:05:10 PM] ‪+91 84988 64446‬: Hey guys!👋🏽 I'm Suswara, I'm from Hyderabad. I'm going to pursue sports management from Columbia SPS. I just wanted to know if there's an ideal timeline for the next steps. I will be submitting my I20 by the end of the week. Relative to that, when would be the right time to start looking for housing, visa slots etc? The steps are clear but the timeline isn't, if someone would help me out I'd really appreciate it :)
[4/14/22, 2:06:16 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: What did you guys enter in the field of “Address where you Will stay in US”
[4/14/22, 2:06:32 PM] Rohit Columbia: In ds160
[4/14/22, 2:06:32 PM] Rohit Columbia: ?
[4/14/22, 2:06:50 PM] Rohit Columbia: Visa slot only after i20 i guess 
Housing you can start looking right away
[4/14/22, 2:07:37 PM] Rohit Columbia: I have added a timeline and details on post-admit process in slack group 
Check it out. Also it would be helpful if someone couldadd to it.
[4/14/22, 2:07:50 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Yes 👏
[4/14/22, 2:08:20 PM] ‪+91 84988 64446‬: Won't you have an issue without even knowing if we'll get the visa or not to check for housing asap?
[4/14/22, 2:08:59 PM] Rohit Columbia: Enter columbia address. I think that should be accepted according to a student there.
I will check once anyway- i also had this question.
[4/14/22, 2:10:01 PM] Rohit Columbia: Nope. You wont 
If you're worried you can always arrange temporary stay at a hotel where you can cancel any time.
[4/14/22, 2:10:44 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Please let me know as well
[4/14/22, 2:11:20 PM] ‪+91 79779 30278‬: If we get a confirmation of this from a coordinator, that would be sorted
[4/14/22, 2:12:16 PM] ‪+91 84988 64446‬: Makes sense, thank you so much :)
[4/14/22, 2:49:47 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: 1. Columbia housing - apply asap for approval and simultaneously look for roommates
2. Off campus housing - checkout ihouse immediately. Other apartments check in july. Housing market moves fast. 
3. Course reg is in july for seas. 
4. Visa slots immediately after i20.

[4/14/22, 3:20:46 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yes, I think, because their website is separate
[4/14/22, 3:21:08 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Anybody knows the cost for on campus housing?
[4/14/22, 3:21:23 PM] ‪+91 90224 80254‬: Ah I'll check it out then
[4/14/22, 3:22:12 PM] ‪+91 88665 72020‬: Yeah yeah I applied before the UNI, it’s okay, you can apply through their website. They would just ask for any kind of confirmation that you have been admitted (like your offer letter)
[4/14/22, 3:22:50 PM] ‪+91 88665 72020‬: I don’t think on campus housing is for grad students? I might be wrong but as far as I know maybe we aren’t allowed on campus housing? The dorms?
[4/14/22, 3:23:25 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: No, Columbia definitely does have on campus housing for grad students
[4/14/22, 3:24:02 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: When you get your UNI, there’s a link to the On Campus Housing application in the email

[4/16/22, 6:25:17 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Even 92k is fine, I'm saying for the safe side because incase the exchange rate changes and so it might be a concern, shouldn't be though but still
[4/16/22, 6:26:30 PM] ‪+91 96328 48068‬: But we do have to mention the sponsor for last sem right?
[4/16/22, 6:28:08 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Yes but that's just for sake of writing, won't matter much while getting i20

[4/16/22, 6:44:28 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You don’t have to give proof of funding
[4/16/22, 6:44:39 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You just have to mention how much you’ll need

[4/16/22, 6:47:44 PM] ‪+91 73395 50659‬: how much fund do we have to show for 3rd sem tuition fee at that time as its only 6 credits?
[4/16/22, 6:48:21 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: 6*2272+ (living expenditure/2)
[4/16/22, 6:48:41 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Again, it really doesn’t matter cause you don’t need to show proof of funding
[4/16/22, 6:49:37 PM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: The advisable amount is 1.5 times the fee mentioned in i20.
[4/16/22, 6:50:37 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: that is at the time of visa no?
[4/16/22, 6:50:42 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: That's for the visa
[4/16/22, 6:51:00 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: in order to get the i20, you can show the exact amount or slightly more
[4/16/22, 6:51:04 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp the 1.5 times is for visa
[4/16/22, 6:51:37 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: For I20, it’s not as rigid. You can show proof of funds for just the first year
[4/16/22, 6:52:53 PM] ‪+91 73395 50659‬: 👍🏻
[4/16/22, 7:00:57 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: This is for engineering, folks
[4/16/22, 7:02:50 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Also I think the per credit fee will change for Fall 22 right?
[4/16/22, 7:03:07 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah it’s predicted to change slightly
[4/16/22, 7:03:23 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: But again, the proof you need to show is based on Previous year fees
[4/16/22, 7:13:14 PM] ‪+91 79958 72808‬: what do we fill as the academic school in the financial certification form?
[4/16/22, 7:52:54 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Have written "Engineering" because for example they've given "Business" and not "Columbia Business School"

[4/18/22, 8:32:00 AM] ‪+91 90820 50695‬: Nope
[4/18/22, 8:32:21 AM] ‪+91 90820 50695‬: You can get it without that
[4/18/22, 9:23:07 AM] ‪+91 98863 20197‬: Sure? But the i20 process can be started only after getting UNI, for which you need to have sent transcripts right?
[4/18/22, 9:23:22 AM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: No
[4/18/22, 9:29:05 AM] ‪+91 90820 50695‬: I got my UNI and the i-20 without sending my transcripts.

[4/18/22, 9:46:09 AM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Try activating your columbia email with the uni and CUID you received. It should also be on your application portal
[4/18/22, 9:51:38 AM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: I've activated my email ID, they just haven't sent me the mail which contains my UNI like they sent to most of you. (I paid my deposit less than a week ago so I guess I would have to wait)

[4/18/22, 10:02:44 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Usually, they generate UNIs but only update their records once they’ve officially sent the email
[4/18/22, 10:02:57 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: So Id advise you to wait for the email

I20 is best. But you can also use last year's/historic fee info to ask for loan.

[4/20/22, 1:47:16 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Don’t book right now unless there is a good reason. Typically the flights are cheapest 1-2 months before the date of travel
[4/20/22, 1:47:34 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: I didn’t find any flights below 70k for mid August

[4/20/22, 1:59:44 PM] ‪+91 98111 94870‬: Yes because if you’re planning to go in mid aug then either you can pay the entire rent of the month for your housing that you chose or you could choose a temporary housing options like air bnbs and all

[4/20/22, 6:09:15 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: That’s because a lot of students travel in August so the flights in August are usually costlier, I know a lot of students who have already started booking their flights

[4/21/22, 10:01:21 AM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: In many cases the immunity test doesn't show it, I know a guy who did that and then had to take a vaccine and again do the immunity test so do check that
[4/21/22, 10:01:55 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: i think the simplest option is to have a medical practitioner fill out the vaccinations form of columbia

[4/21/22, 3:27:22 PM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: Is the tuition fee amount given here - https://isso.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/rates/eng.pdf , mentioned under academic year, for the full 1.5 years period or just for one year? Because when I multiple cost per credit (~$2000) with total number of credits for 1.5 years (30), I am getting an amount close to what is given here
[4/21/22, 3:27:26 PM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: Just wanted to confirm
[4/21/22, 3:31:49 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: The total expenses here include approx cost of living as well
[4/21/22, 3:38:04 PM] ‪+91 84894 45657‬: Its for an academic year only but for 24 credits for first two sems
[4/21/22, 3:38:19 PM] ‪+91 84894 45657‬: The last sem its generally 6 credits
[4/21/22, 3:39:46 PM] ‪+91 84894 45657‬: And the actual credit cost is ~$2300 so i think thats why your 1.5 yr estimate is clise to their 1 yr estimate
[4/21/22, 3:42:58 PM] ‪+91 98694 30357‬: This cost is for 24credits(1 academic year) but this includes the tuition cost as well as all miscellaneous expenses such as facilities fees, health insurance, etc
[4/21/22, 3:47:16 PM] ‪+91 73395 50659‬: I asked current 1st yr students, they will be paying around 17k for 3rd sem

I heard some of them were getting it within 2-5 days earlier,  wanted to confirm.
[4/22/22, 1:08:47 AM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: While providing financial proof for I-20, can we show multiple sources? Like if I wanted to show some part through a loan sanction letter and some through personal finances(bank statement/letter) , could I do that?

[4/22/22, 1:34:17 AM] ‪+91 98111 94870‬: + harlem is not considered safe enough according to a senior and a lot others i spoke to
[4/22/22, 1:38:14 AM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: 😮 It's like half a mile from Columbia.

[4/22/22, 11:44:30 AM] Haya Columbia: Airbnb is very expensive anywhere.
[4/22/22, 11:51:35 AM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: Same opinion. I was suggested to not even stay close to it
[4/22/22, 11:51:58 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yep, I was suggested the same
[4/22/22, 11:52:22 AM] ‪+91 88665 72020‬: Yeah so above 125th street is unsafe, that’s what I was told
[4/22/22, 11:52:52 AM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: That isn’t but it’s one lane away. Uni is v safe but the residential area around isn’t the best at night
[4/22/22, 11:53:17 AM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: A mutual friend stayed there for a while and she didn’t leave her house after 6pm cause she was that scared
[4/22/22, 11:53:19 AM] Haya Columbia: Nowhere in nyc is safe at night lol

[4/22/22, 11:53:58 AM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: True but you want to be able to leave if you want and there are areas which are good enough for that
[4/22/22, 11:54:00 AM] Haya Columbia: I get that. Really.

I know a few things cause of friends there but not too much in depth hahah
[4/22/22, 11:55:40 AM] Haya Columbia: If you wanna live in Manhattan/Queens/brooklyn/bronx/SI you're gonna have to have to trade off some concerns.
[4/22/22, 11:55:42 AM] Haya Columbia: But look
[4/22/22, 11:55:53 AM] Haya Columbia: If you love in a built up area with good lighting at night
[4/22/22, 11:56:01 AM] Haya Columbia: And stay to main roads
[4/22/22, 11:56:14 AM] Haya Columbia: low chance you'll run into trouble
[4/22/22, 11:59:43 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: why is Harlem so notorious?
[4/22/22, 11:59:44 AM] Haya Columbia: Secaucus to penn station is like 10-15 min on the NJT or Amtrak. 

Penn station to Colmubia would be like another 10-15 min on the subway
[4/22/22, 11:59:48 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: what happens there? 🙄
[4/22/22, 12:00:41 PM] Haya Columbia: About a century ago, it was full of low income families. 
Racist policing on top of that. 

Pushed a lot of people to crime Back then. That cycle continues to today.
[4/22/22, 12:01:10 PM] Haya Columbia: It's still a low income neighbourhood by manhattan standards
[4/22/22, 12:01:25 PM] ‪+91 88665 72020‬: No so Penn to Columbia is more like 25 mins atleast by subway! I lived near Penn station and was going to Columbia often last year so the actual time it takes is around 25 mins atleast and if you have to wait for the train then extra 5 mins
[4/22/22, 12:01:55 PM] Haya Columbia: Ig real world times are a bit different
[4/22/22, 12:02:14 PM] Haya Columbia: But still can get to CU from secaucus or Hoboken in under an hour.
[4/22/22, 12:02:30 PM] ‪+91 88665 72020‬: And NJ (journal square) to Penn is also like 20 mins atleast so overall if you have to travel from NJ to Columbia it would take approx 45 mins to 1 hour
[4/22/22, 12:02:49 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: how safe is NJ?
[4/22/22, 12:02:50 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Which is quite a lot
[4/22/22, 12:03:04 PM] Haya Columbia: It's not really quantifiable is it?
[4/22/22, 12:03:05 PM] ‪+91 88665 72020‬: Yeah NJ is safer than Manhattan for sure
[4/22/22, 12:03:10 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: really inch-a-resting
[4/22/22, 12:03:34 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: there are some indicators
[4/22/22, 12:03:38 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: like racist crimes
[4/22/22, 12:03:38 PM] Haya Columbia: But less of a chance you'll get mugged for your kicks
[4/22/22, 12:04:00 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: in general is US not very safe to live?
[4/22/22, 12:04:17 PM] Haya Columbia: Okay lemme lay this down clearly. 

You are an Indian, going to a country that isn't majority indian, and has a massive racism problem with trigger happy idiots
[4/22/22, 12:04:43 PM] Haya Columbia: Safety relies on how well you take care of yourself rather than the neighbourhood
[4/22/22, 12:05:06 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Another way, get a NJ Transit bus which stops at Times Square and then take a subway to Columbia
[4/22/22, 12:05:07 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: makes sense
[4/22/22, 12:05:14 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Looks like we have our very own US housing guide
[4/22/22, 12:05:47 PM] Haya Columbia: Idk where journal Square is, but I've made it to edison from the upper east side in like 70 min.
[4/22/22, 12:06:06 PM] Haya Columbia: iirc the 6 train and express njt
[4/22/22, 12:06:16 PM] Haya Columbia: Lol.
[4/22/22, 12:06:40 PM] Haya Columbia: I've some experience with living in seedy/shady areas withiut getting in trouble
[4/22/22, 12:06:58 PM] Haya Columbia: Cos, lemme tell you.
RENT IS SOOO MUCH CHEAPER IF YOU LIVE IN UNSAFE NEIGHBOURHOODS😂😂😂😂😂
[4/22/22, 12:07:11 PM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: Guys relax we all have decided to go. We have to stay there. Stop being paranoid I would say and enjoy the process
[4/22/22, 12:07:17 PM] Haya Columbia: Exactly
[4/22/22, 12:07:59 PM] Haya Columbia: Wrt housing and safety, If you're living off campus, try to look up stats for that specific neighbourhoods if youre really concerned
[4/22/22, 12:08:10 PM] Haya Columbia: You cant generalize an entire area as safe/unsafe
[4/22/22, 12:09:39 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: ++
[4/22/22, 12:09:41 PM] Haya Columbia: I've known kids who run around alone in brookly and I know people who have gotten mugged in tribeca. 

It's a matter of chance.
So dont worry about it too much. 

Look at it empirically
[4/22/22, 12:10:11 PM] Haya Columbia: Lol. Im trying very hard to give a non-political answer.
[4/22/22, 12:11:39 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: pay a couple hundred bucks more but live in a well maintained neighborhood i guess
[4/22/22, 12:11:54 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: but is the difference bigger?
[4/22/22, 12:11:55 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: I'd suggest that go in a group wherever you go in the starting phase
[4/22/22, 12:12:18 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: in any phase for that matter 😂
[4/22/22, 12:13:22 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: I know a guy who stays in Jersey, hangs out in New York, travels back alone at 2 AM from New York to Jersey
[4/22/22, 12:13:47 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: isn't 2 am too late to be back?

It's late evening for nyc
[4/22/22, 12:15:59 PM] Haya Columbia: Oh guys.
[4/22/22, 12:16:02 PM] Haya Columbia: Btw
[4/22/22, 12:16:19 PM] Haya Columbia: Be ready to hear sirens 24x7.
Like ALL THE TIME
[4/22/22, 12:16:33 PM] Haya Columbia: Regardless of where in nyc you live
[4/22/22, 12:16:46 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: what's with the sirens?
[4/22/22, 12:17:00 PM] Haya Columbia: Cops, ambulances, fire trucks, the usual
[4/22/22, 12:17:12 PM] Haya Columbia: But it's so constant
[4/22/22, 12:17:34 PM] Haya Columbia: Esp if you live on the ground floor (aka first floor in the US), it'll take some getting used to
[4/22/22, 12:21:34 PM] Haya Columbia: Although, you can get a police scanner, make it a fun game.
When you hear dispatch on the scanner, figure out if you'll hear a siren. Or vice versa. Try to figure out where a siren is coming from by listening to the scanner😂
[4/22/22, 12:23:19 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: Guys, super interesting conversation but can you do the NYC/USA crash course privately there’s 187 people on the group, some of whom don’t necessarily want it

[4/22/22, 1:05:34 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: Definitely muting groups is obvious, but if there’s so much unnecessary commentary the important information gets lost… which is why we joined a huge group like this in the first place. I don’t think anyone specifically asked for advice about police scanners but if you have something universally important to share, no one’s stopping you.
[4/22/22, 1:07:02 PM] Haya Columbia: Well. That was one fun thing in around 20 messages of relevant information
[4/22/22, 1:07:14 PM] Haya Columbia: Fair
[4/22/22, 1:08:40 PM] Haya Columbia: For people who have never lived outside before, any small piece if information, (including the thing about sirens because it affects productivity and concentration, a major thing for students) is highly relevant.

[4/23/22, 8:01:55 PM] Adith Columbia: So, you can do that, but it can take anywhere between 1-5 days, and you'll be paying an extra 25-40 usd depending on the provider (Western Union, transferwise etc etc). You're probably better off paying through a credit card /debit card that has international transactions enabled.

[4/24/22, 8:08:21 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Has anyone applied to leap finance and gotten a loan sanction letter?
[4/24/22, 8:08:35 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Also if someone can guide on which is better leap or prodigy?
[4/24/22, 8:37:19 PM] ‪+91 99250 30972‬: Leap appears to have a significantly lower interest rate (~2%) compared to prodigy. Additionally, leap's interest rate will remain fixed over the loan tenure whereas prodigy has a floating rate which will likely increase in the future. I believe leap is US-based so will help the applicant build a US credit history whereas prodigy being a UK-based company will not. To me, leap appears to be better but take others' opinion also.
[4/24/22, 9:13:26 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: Leap is based in Bangalore, they’re an Indian company. And the 2% you’re referring to is the processing fee.. not the interest rate- I think that’s between 8.5 and 12 (depending on your profile)
[4/24/22, 9:23:52 PM] ‎‪+91 77770 67536‬ joined using this group's invite link
[4/24/22, 9:15:23 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Yeah the interest rate of both is kinda sam
[4/24/22, 9:15:33 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: But one is fixed other is variable
[4/24/22, 9:16:00 PM] ‪+91 98815 54914‬: Yes.. I got 9% intrest rate when i checked
[4/24/22, 9:46:29 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Depends on your preference mate.

The interest rate you get depends on your profile. You can definitely get a lower interest rate from prodigy as compared to leap finance. For leap, you need to make monthly payments even during your studies, although the amount is small (~50 $). In Prodigy, you are not required to make such payments, you can if you want to for building credit history. 

Leap offers a maximum repayment tenure of 10 years, prodigy offers 20 years. From leap, you can get a maximum loan amount of 100k $, prodigy sometimes offer a lot higher than that (Can go up to 140k even)

For me, non Co-signer based loan was a major preference. I got a significantly lower interest rate from prodigy as compared to leap as well. Hence it made more sense to go with prodigy.
[4/24/22, 9:47:11 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: But the interest rate is variable
[4/24/22, 9:47:20 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: It changes every three months
[4/24/22, 9:48:24 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Yes it is variable.
[4/24/22, 9:48:29 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: By not a lot
[4/24/22, 9:49:23 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: And in leap u can decrease the interest rate coz its negotiable
[4/24/22, 9:49:25 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Both have their own merits and demerits. Choose based on your preference
[4/24/22, 9:50:13 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: You can definitely try
[4/25/22, 12:39:13 PM] Disha Khanted Columbia: Is anyone here looking at gyandhan loan options
[4/25/22, 1:56:28 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Has anybody applied for their loan through Vidyalakshmi portal ?
[4/25/22, 2:17:19 PM] ‪+91 99250 30972‬: In my case i think it was 8.5% from leap vs 10.6 % from prodigy thereby giving a 2 % difference not taking into account the processing fee. Processing fee is an altogether different criteria which is also critical in comparing the lenders. Anyways, as others suggested, one has to decide for themselves considering that the loan is a long term obligation and has significant financial implications.

Influenza can be taken just a couple weeks before you head to uni, which is basically just a flu shot for the upcoming season

     Hope this email finds you well. Correct, Columbia offers the flu vaccine to student. An email with more information will be sent later in the year to your Columbia email.

Yes, a booster dose requirement has been announced and will take effect shortly. You will need to upload documentation of your booster dose to the health portal. Please be aware that if your initial COVID-19 vaccine series was with a vaccine not approved by the FDA, then only Pfizer is acceptable as a booster dose. 

Please see our FAQ page for further information:

[4/26/22, 11:40:24 PM] Rohit Columbia: Just a heads up 
This is fda approved vaccine booster 
So covaxin or covishield will not be accepted as booster 
Something to be kept in mind. You need physician signature there as well to be exempted for booster.
[4/26/22, 11:44:09 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: ab Pfizer kaha lene jaye?
[4/26/22, 11:45:53 PM] Rohit Columbia: Only Pfizer has been authorized by the FDA as a booster dose for those who received Covaxin or another non-FDA-approved initial vaccine series. The Pfizer booster dose is required once you have reached 5 months after finishing your Covixin series. If you will not yet be in the U.S. at that time, and will not have access to Pfizer vaccine, you will need to upload a medical exemption request form along with supporting documentation from a physician stating that Pfizer vaccine is unavailable to you. The request form can be found on the Columbia Health website under 'Forms and Guidelines'.

Please see statement below; 
"Only the Pfizer vaccine will be accepted for a booster to follow the non-FDA-authorized vaccine primary series.

For example, if an individual received 3 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, a Pfizer-BioNTech booster dose would also need to be administered at least 28 days after the third Sinopharm dose."

[4/28/22, 9:27:17 PM] Rohit Columbia: One second, to clarify the issue is only with booster not the vaccine. 
For booster both covishield and covaxin need exemption as they are not fda approved. I asked specifically about indian vaccine covaxin.
They will ask you the pfizer booster when they update the portal. Idk when they will

[4/29/22, 10:36:07 PM] Rohit Columbia: Visa interview yes you need to be able to prove you have funds for education.
[4/29/22, 10:39:21 PM] ‪+91 82801 33261‬: For both years?
[4/29/22, 10:51:15 PM] Rohit Columbia: Its really subjective... 
Ideally, I20 amount is sufficient but it invites questions. If you show proof with a margin on top of i20, like others have suggested in this group (1.5x), you will essentially avoid questions in that direction.. 
if we dont we might have to explain the funding for 2nd year.... 
Hope this makes sense.

[4/30/22, 4:14:26 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: Follow up question regarding Columbia Health portal.
1. For Covid we can just mention dates of 2 doses of vaccine and upload certificate (if no booster dose taken) is that enough ? 
2. For MMR , mentioning the dates of Mumps 2 doses ,Measles Rubella 1 dose vaccine taken and uploading doctor signed proof , does that work ?
What else apart from these need to be done incase someone from this group has cleared all the compliances shown on Columbia Health portal or in review stages?
[4/30/22, 4:16:28 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: 1. Yes, I uploaded just two doses and they approved.
[4/30/22, 4:17:17 PM] ‪+91 98193 22020‬: Same
[4/30/22, 4:17:31 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: 2. I am not sure about the vaccine itself, but I got the antibody test done (3K for all 3 together), filled the MMR form, got it signed by a local doctor, attached the test report and they approved it.
[4/30/22, 4:17:32 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: If we don't recall the dates for MMR vaccines or don't have the old vaccination certificates, what can we do?
[4/30/22, 4:18:36 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Get the antibody test (each of the 3 diseases as an igg variant of the test that you need to take).
[4/30/22, 4:19:13 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: So how did you fill the form with the dates of vaccination mentioned?
[4/30/22, 4:19:15 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Antibody test
[4/30/22, 4:19:20 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: okay i have the dates and report card , can i get a report signed by doctor physician and upload that ? or there is a specific format and only that is allowed ?
[4/30/22, 4:19:23 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: I did IGG and IGM both to be on safer side
[4/30/22, 4:19:49 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: IGM is only if you have recently had the disease and want to know that you are disease free. It is not for proving long term immunity.
[4/30/22, 4:20:06 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Tick the testing part and you’re good to go
[4/30/22, 4:20:16 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: Great. Thanks a lot
[4/30/22, 4:20:20 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Get the MMR form signed by the doctor and upload that alongside the dates and the report card. No format.
[4/30/22, 4:20:42 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: Did you also fill the covid booster dose exemption form?
[4/30/22, 4:21:26 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: Is that optional or required? Since some guidelines have now changed
[4/30/22, 4:21:47 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I didn't. I expect they will put a new hold later requesting for boosters. For now it doesn't show up in SSOL

Kidding. LGA doesn't have a lot of long haul international traffic comparatively.
[4/30/22, 10:15:32 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: there were only 3 options in emirates: ewr, nyc, jfk

[4/30/22, 10:54:51 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Couldn't care about the discount but could have used 23 kg extra

[4/30/22, 11:00:16 PM] Rohit Columbia: Emirates requires self transfer right
[4/30/22, 11:02:37 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Meaning?
[4/30/22, 11:03:09 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: no
[4/30/22, 11:03:29 PM] Rohit Columbia: All right
[4/30/22, 11:04:10 PM] Rohit Columbia: I meant to ask if you will have to collect the baggage and transfer to connecting flight yourself
[4/30/22, 11:05:02 PM] Rohit Columbia: The ones I checked only had have self transfer. 
Thats why asked...
[4/30/22, 11:08:03 PM] Rohit Columbia: 🙌 we'll catch up before that...
[4/30/22, 11:10:11 PM] ‪+91 79809 16814‬: Oh okay. That's good then :)
[4/30/22, 11:34:55 PM] Haya Columbia: Thats regardless.

I always have dhotis, kurtas, etc
[4/30/22, 11:34:56 PM] Haya Columbia: All airlines offer studnet discounts aug-sep
 
Usually its extra luggage
[4/30/22, 11:34:56 PM] Haya Columbia: They require proof when checking in. I've been asked for student id or admission letter before at check in when i booked online with student discount
[4/30/22, 11:34:57 PM] Haya Columbia: Even if You have booked, you can add extra luggage for free now by calling emirates and saying so
[4/30/22, 11:34:59 PM] Haya Columbia: 2.5 hours is absolute minimum necessary for layovers like this esp in DXB
[4/30/22, 11:37:56 PM] ‪+91 90870 18853‬: So finally, is the i20 or admission letter proof enough for the airlines for a student booking?
[4/30/22, 11:38:54 PM] Tejas Columbia: F1 visa should be enough to let them know you’re a student
[5/1/22, 1:07:21 PM] ‪+91 90870 18853‬: Guys, is anyone getting an 'unable to validate captcha' error when you try to create a profile to pay for your visa after your ds 160?

[5/1/22, 8:36:20 PM] ‪+91 82801 33261‬: Is anyone looking to book tickets on  Qatar airways?
[5/1/22, 8:36:40 PM] Haya Columbia: Me
[5/1/22, 8:36:54 PM] Haya Columbia: It's my first preference atleast
[5/1/22, 8:38:05 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: It has a student club too, do join that. Has some benefits.
[5/1/22, 8:38:37 PM] Haya Columbia: Oh!
[5/1/22, 8:39:01 PM] Haya Columbia: Could you share a URL or something, please?
[5/1/22, 8:40:02 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: Hey, you can just Google it. Quite famous. 10% off + extra luggage
[5/1/22, 8:40:35 PM] Haya Columbia: Alright thank you :))
[5/1/22, 8:40:50 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: is it available only withbQatar Airways?
[5/1/22, 8:41:11 PM] Haya Columbia: I know emirates and BA offer student discounts
[5/1/22, 8:41:19 PM] Haya Columbia: Etihad too
[5/1/22, 8:41:21 PM] Haya Columbia: Most airlines do tbh
[5/1/22, 8:41:27 PM] Haya Columbia: Just differs what it is
[5/1/22, 8:41:36 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: Alr
[5/1/22, 8:41:42 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: thanks :)
[5/1/22, 8:41:51 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: is this the right time to book tickets?
[5/1/22, 8:43:17 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: Had the same question, like even before we get a visa?
[5/1/22, 8:43:36 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: Exactly
[5/1/22, 8:45:51 PM] Haya Columbia: If you've got everything else sorted (funding, i20, ds160, etc) go ahead. It's really upto you 
But ticket prices will only increase
[5/1/22, 8:46:53 PM] ‪+91 82801 33261‬: Is the baggage allowance offered for student club just 10kg ? As opposed to 23 kg for other airlines like Emirates?
[5/1/22, 8:47:16 PM] Haya Columbia: So many european countries make you show the ticket to get a visa.

US is the other way around. They recommend you dont book till after just in case you get rejected. But tbh, no one here is gonna get rejected unless they lied or something.

So I'd sau, for the sake of saving money, book as early as you prefer
[5/1/22, 8:47:29 PM] Haya Columbia: Usually 23kg afaik
[5/1/22, 8:48:13 PM] ‪+91 82801 33261‬: I guess it's better to look for airlines which do not charge additional rescheduling fee and you would just have to pay the difference in cost. Qatar airways and Emirates offer this as far as I know
[5/1/22, 8:48:35 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: Yeah, got it. Thanks!!

[5/1/22, 8:49:03 PM] Haya Columbia: Hmm
[5/1/22, 8:49:08 PM] ‪+91 82801 33261‬: This is what I found on the student club page
[5/1/22, 8:49:10 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: It's extra 10 kg for students. Not sure what's their general limit
[5/1/22, 8:49:50 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: It depends on the route
[5/1/22, 8:50:00 PM] Haya Columbia: This
[5/1/22, 8:50:00 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: For America they allow 23Kgs if I’m right
[5/1/22, 8:50:20 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: I had a senior who was traveling from durham to nyc, and qatar airways lost his luggage
[5/1/22, 8:50:24 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: True that!
[5/1/22, 8:50:26 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Took a long time to find it
[5/1/22, 8:50:33 PM] Haya Columbia: So gulf region airlines typically offer weight limits rather than piece limits
[5/1/22, 8:50:37 PM] Haya Columbia: Like 30kg per ticket.
[5/1/22, 8:50:52 PM] Haya Columbia: But TSA (in the us) requires the 23/32kg thing
[5/1/22, 8:51:04 PM] Haya Columbia: So all flights to the US will always follow that pattern
[5/1/22, 8:51:34 PM] Haya Columbia: So, this.....
[5/1/22, 8:51:54 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: ‎This message was deleted.
[5/1/22, 8:52:07 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Any reason no one is talking about Saudia? Half price of emirates. Even with paid additional baggage it is much cheaper.
[5/1/22, 8:52:24 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: 46k right now
[5/1/22, 8:52:37 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: 😮 That's like half
[5/1/22, 8:56:29 PM] Haya Columbia: I just saw that yesterday but didnt Cos it's not a great airline comparatively
[5/1/22, 9:01:05 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: any repercussions of going with the cheaper option. Like we'll be there only for 24 hours or sth
[5/1/22, 9:01:19 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: ? *
[5/1/22, 9:01:39 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: its a 14 hr flight just from uae to usa
[5/1/22, 9:01:56 PM] Haya Columbia: Well, delays, double booking, and lost baggage, are typically the only issues when choosing lesser airlines
[5/1/22, 9:01:56 PM] Rohit Columbia: Since its a long journey if its not comfortable 
It will be quite difficult
[5/1/22, 9:02:00 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I was thinking the same. Half price for the chance of some inconvenience doesn’t seem like a bad deal
[5/1/22, 9:02:04 PM] Haya Columbia: Oh yeah. Confort too
[5/1/22, 9:02:17 PM] Haya Columbia: Economy class wise. Emirates a380 is the best ive ever flown
[5/1/22, 9:02:31 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: it's only one day of your life 😂
[5/1/22, 9:02:42 PM] Haya Columbia: One entire day sitting in a box?
[5/1/22, 9:02:45 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: according to my dad even in economy in emirates there's enough leg space
[5/1/22, 9:02:46 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: I'm sure you've been in more uncomfortable situations
[5/1/22, 9:03:03 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: sitting in a box?
[5/1/22, 9:03:07 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: it varies from person to person
[5/1/22, 9:03:11 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: and their budget
[5/1/22, 9:03:15 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: i dont think they will make it this uncomfortable
[5/1/22, 9:03:16 PM] Haya Columbia: Yesss
[5/1/22, 9:03:26 PM] Haya Columbia: Look up ryanair lol
[5/1/22, 9:03:39 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: some people can even go for business class or first class without so much as batting an eye
[5/1/22, 9:03:41 PM] Haya Columbia: If the seats arent comfortable, it will feel like sitting in a box
[5/1/22, 9:03:48 PM] Haya Columbia: I was just gonna say
[5/1/22, 9:03:56 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: what matters is it fits your budget
[5/1/22, 9:04:00 PM] Haya Columbia: Business class means Qatar is best.
Emirates is close second
[5/1/22, 9:04:16 PM] Haya Columbia: I've never flown business in these tho😂
[5/1/22, 9:04:21 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: just one day!!
[5/1/22, 9:04:40 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: unless they're going to crash the plane, I'm all right
[5/1/22, 9:04:47 PM] Haya Columbia: I was in air india from EWR to BOM

I moved my seat and the entire flight's entertainment system crashed 😳
[5/1/22, 9:04:53 PM] Haya Columbia: Upto you man

[5/1/22, 9:05:23 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: ..
[5/1/22, 9:05:28 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: I'm not tryna convince
[5/1/22, 9:05:41 PM] Haya Columbia: I'll most likely go for Emirates, etihad, or qatar for two main reasons:

1. Comfort
2. Preclearance (not in emirates tho)
[5/1/22, 9:05:46 PM] Haya Columbia: Thays my preference
[5/1/22, 9:05:47 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: I'm just trying to understand what might go wrong with a cheaper option
[5/1/22, 9:05:58 PM] Haya Columbia: A guy i know is rravelling lufthansa because he likes transitting in FRA

[5/1/22, 9:08:11 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: comfort
quality of customer care and reception towards your queries in flight
the quality of crowd (for eg. unusually loud people in large numbers or those without a regard of others)
[5/1/22, 9:08:42 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: Makes sense
[5/1/22, 9:08:50 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: I'll take this into account
[5/1/22, 9:09:06 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: once in indigo i ringed that bell which calls the stewardess like 5 times
[5/1/22, 9:09:13 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: just to come her once
[5/1/22, 9:09:33 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: and had did that another 5 times to have me bring a blanket
[5/1/22, 9:09:40 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: so approx 20 times
[5/1/22, 9:10:21 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: lol
[5/1/22, 9:10:38 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: another time while i was flying flydubai there were 2 people who kept sneezing without so much as covering their noses or put the mask on
[5/1/22, 9:10:49 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: and that was during covid
[5/1/22, 9:11:00 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: and they were near me
[5/1/22, 9:12:31 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: and my dad who's like the most frugal person ever told me directly to go for emirates
[5/1/22, 9:13:00 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: because he has travelled in every airline to every country(almost)
[5/1/22, 9:13:20 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: Apart from all these comfort issues, I was just asking this question to a friend (who has a bit of idea) , he said SaudiA recently added India to its bubble in Jan and if cases increase, they might cancel. Though the probability is very low.
[5/1/22, 9:13:55 PM] Haya Columbia: Thats another thing


Emirates is deep in the pockets of every government lol so they'll keep all their bubbles
[5/1/22, 9:14:15 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: I am still thinking about taking the gamble 😛
[5/1/22, 9:14:44 PM] Haya Columbia: Go for it. 
Make sure you get travel insurance
[5/1/22, 9:16:17 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: 😄 Will surely get the insurance if I go with this
[5/1/22, 9:16:30 PM] Haya Columbia: Get the insurance regardless

[5/9/22, 2:22:05 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Actually one question, which all vaccines are eligible? 
The website said - 
All vaccines whichever were authorised for emergency use by who. So, something like any of these - https://covid19.trackvaccines.org/agency/who/
[5/9/22, 2:23:02 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Also for proof for the vaccines mentioned on their website, how are you guys going about it?
[5/9/22, 2:24:18 PM] ‪+91 86076 88276‬: I think we just need to fill the forms against each vaccination on the portal and get the forms signed by an authorised doctor. Pleaee correct me if I’m wrong.
[5/9/22, 4:06:37 PM] Rohit Columbia: The vaccination certificate should  be sufficient.
[5/9/22, 4:28:49 PM] Rohit Columbia: As of now it is limited this to Columbia.
Extending to other unis is a great idea as far as it doesn't reach a spammer.
But since everyone is involved here, we might have to get their consent. I don't see any problem with this idea.

[5/11/22, 11:15:50 PM] ‪+91 91 6720 774 7‬: Second para says “if any dose of primary series was non-WHO-authorized”
So doesn’t apply to covaxin/covishield
[5/11/22, 11:16:02 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: the screenshot is saying exactly the opposite
[5/11/22, 11:16:27 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: That’s why I initially said… first try uploading your covi shield booster dose… in case it doesn’t get approved, it will anyways get clear

[5/11/22, 11:19:05 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: if any dose was WHO authorized, the booster dose must be a pfizer
[5/11/22, 11:19:52 PM] ‪+91 91 6720 774 7‬: pretty sure that is non-(FDA-authorised/WHO-authorised)

[5/11/22, 11:40:56 PM] Rohit Columbia: I got a doctors sign jn the medical exemption for pfizer
[5/11/22, 11:41:22 PM] Rohit Columbia: There is a form available in forms and guidelines section
[5/11/22, 11:41:25 PM] Rohit Columbia: That should work
[5/11/22, 11:41:29 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: Covishield and Covaxin _*are*_ WHO authorised/not FDA approved therefore if your first or second dose (or both) was either of these two, then you *have* to take Pfizer. 
Basically this FAQ is just clarifying that even if you took the combination of 1 Covaxin  + 1 Pfizer, you still need a Pfizer booster.
[5/11/22, 11:42:22 PM] ‪+91 91 6040 500 6‬: Oh okay
[5/11/22, 11:42:32 PM] ‪+91 91 6040 500 6‬: Right makes sense, thanks!
[5/11/22, 11:45:27 PM] Rohit Columbia: The deadline for the booster dose or the exemption is not updated yet 
So even if you don't submit one you're compliant. They will update the portal later as per info from CU health. 
I had forwarded the mail chain a month ago - check it up

If you've ever applied for a visa before. Try using that account to log in

[5/13/22, 1:18:23 PM] ‪+91 94238 86406‬: Yeah so try logging through those details or just wait there must be some site problem which is not allowing you to create a new account

[5/13/22, 2:49:46 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Not necessary for interview, as you can even show your property evaluations
[5/13/22, 2:50:08 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Even Mutual Fund evaluations are fine
[5/13/22, 2:53:17 PM] ‪+91 90870 18853‬: Mutual funds, stocks etc. In your parents'name works right?
[5/13/22, 2:53:28 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yep
[5/13/22, 2:53:34 PM] ‪+91 90870 18853‬: And property evaluation as certified by a CA works?
[5/13/22, 2:53:53 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: But if we have shown 1.5 times the amount required in the i-20 itself we can just show that much itself right?
[5/13/22, 2:54:14 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: I’m not 100% sure. My counsellor said that it’s better if you go for an evaluation certified by a government agency
[5/13/22, 2:54:26 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yes that’s fine
[5/13/22, 2:54:50 PM] ‪+91 79809 16814‬: Got it. So by that logic OF should also work then🤔 anyone who can confirm on this?
[5/13/22, 2:55:31 PM] ‪+91 79809 16814‬: *PF
[5/13/22, 2:56:02 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: Not sure about this.
[5/13/22, 2:56:34 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: I don’t think PF would work cause if I remember correctly they have a maturity date only after which you can withdraw them
[5/13/22, 2:57:57 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: A part of it is withdrawble. That you need to check with your bank. I did the same.
[5/13/22, 2:58:02 PM] Haya Columbia: I believe anything that can be liquidated quickly is valid
[5/13/22, 2:58:17 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: Yep
[5/13/22, 2:58:18 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: After maturity whole amount is withdrawble.
[5/13/22, 2:58:40 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: Exactly

[5/13/22, 2:59:46 PM] Haya Columbia: You cpuld get a letter from the bank saying value of your investment is X and if you withdraw it before a certain date, it can be immediately liquidated to a particular amount Y after charges and taxes
[5/13/22, 2:59:52 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: PF works as well, so long as you have the letter stating it can be withdrawn
[5/13/22, 2:59:53 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: No major penalties

[5/14/22, 5:09:27 PM] ‪+91 95130 83360‬: Guys did anyone get the loan from leap finance?
[5/14/22, 5:10:34 PM] ‪+91 95130 83360‬: Is it trustworthy? I was considering either this or prodigy
[5/14/22, 5:12:09 PM] ‪+91 98117 01532‬: I've taken a loan from them
[5/14/22, 5:14:22 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: Prodigy
[5/14/22, 5:14:39 PM] ‪+91 98815 54914‬: Yes
[5/14/22, 5:15:05 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Not very reliable
[5/14/22, 5:16:16 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: When I took from leap, didn't know about prodigy, so can't compare. But I talked to a guy in Columbia who took from leap and had a seemless experience with disbursements.
[5/14/22, 5:16:33 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: Oh is it?
[5/14/22, 5:17:05 PM] ‪+91 98117 01532‬: I know a few people who took a loan from leap and they're satisfied
[5/14/22, 5:18:01 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Yes
[5/14/22, 5:19:20 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: From both?
[5/14/22, 5:19:53 PM] Ankit Gupta: what are the interest rates for prodigy and leap?
[5/14/22, 5:19:54 PM] Ankit Gupta: or they vary?
[5/14/22, 5:19:56 PM] ‪+91 98117 01532‬: Sorry, I meant leap
[5/14/22, 5:20:28 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: They are backed by Sequoia and Harvard, so seemed reliable to me. So I just went ahead 🤞🏻
[5/14/22, 5:20:47 PM] ‪+91 98815 54914‬: Leap 9% without mortgage.
[5/14/22, 5:20:56 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Alright
[5/14/22, 5:21:25 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: Alright
[5/14/22, 5:22:58 PM] ‪+91 95130 83360‬: Oh okay, thanks guys, I know many ppl who took loan from prodigy, but didn’t know anyone from leap finance. 

The advantages with leap are more, so I was leaning towards it. I’ll probably go with it then

[5/14/22, 5:26:29 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: I've taken a loan from leap. The process was pretty simple too. Plus I got a much better interest rate from leap than prodigy, so I went ahead with it
[5/14/22, 5:28:49 PM] ‪+91 99426 56157‬: But you have to pay 2% processing fee in leap
[5/14/22, 5:29:57 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: As opposed to 5% with prodigy so made more sense to me

[5/14/22, 8:34:36 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Best to get it corrected asap
[5/14/22, 8:35:31 PM] ‪+91 98830 15080‬: I mailed the email id which sent the I20. That the ISSO email na?

[5/15/22, 1:36:03 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: has the mandate come into effect yet?
[5/15/22, 1:36:52 PM] ‪+91 95130 83360‬: I saw these discussions on this group earlier, from what I gathered: 

1. MMR, you can get it tested - antigen test, download the form and get it signed by a doctor and upload it along with test results. This is incase you don’t have your vaccination records. 
2. You can decline meningitis, it’s optional
3. Get a flu shot 

Guys correct me if I’m wrong.

[5/15/22, 1:39:51 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: So if course registration starts before we reach US, won't it be safer to take a booster right now?
[5/15/22, 1:40:21 PM] Ankit Gupta: I took mine just the day before yesterday
Best be safe and take the booster to upload it
[5/15/22, 1:40:52 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: did you take a WHO approved booster?

[5/16/22, 11:13:17 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: already did 😓
[5/16/22, 11:14:16 AM] ‪+91 79958 98660‬: Has anyone updated their DS 160 after booking their visa appointment?
I'm considering this because of the "duration of stay": I filled it as 2 years. Would this cause issues cause in the i20 it's like 16 months?
[5/16/22, 11:16:48 AM] ‪+91 97402 26020‬: I did, better to fill in 16 months
[5/16/22, 11:17:20 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: You can update it

[5/16/22, 11:24:57 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s 16 according to I20, but one month here and there is fine
[5/16/22, 11:40:44 AM] ‪+91 98193 22020‬: Cool thanks!
[5/16/22, 12:05:44 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: I did mail them and I got my i20 the next day. They didn't respond to the mail so maybe coincidence 🤷‍♂️

[5/19/22, 5:27:11 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Anyone checking for slots today?

[5/20/22, 10:36:26 AM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: Has anyone added that?
[5/20/22, 10:36:31 AM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: Is there a con to that?
[5/20/22, 10:41:34 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Yes u can add date and if they ask u can say u r planning to travel around that time
[5/20/22, 10:42:22 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Don't tell u already booked ticket, that might sound overconfident..
[5/20/22, 10:43:10 AM] Haya Columbia: Some opened last night and soem more this morning
[5/20/22, 10:43:34 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Yea but the slots are filling like tatkal tickets 😅
[5/20/22, 10:43:34 AM] Haya Columbia: No such thing. 
They dont care if you've booked or not
[5/20/22, 10:43:42 AM] Haya Columbia: Agents.
[5/20/22, 10:43:48 AM] ‪+91 98815 54914‬: 🤣🤣
[5/20/22, 10:43:51 AM] Haya Columbia: You have to check every couple hours
[5/20/22, 10:44:21 AM] Haya Columbia: I somehow am in disbelief that dropbox slots are going faster than interview slots
[5/20/22, 10:44:23 AM] ‪+91 96431 20943‬: But we can login only 3 times right?🫢
[5/20/22, 10:44:48 AM] Haya Columbia: I logged in over 5 times yesterday
[5/20/22, 10:44:57 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: I got warning yesterday saying you have checked multiple times..
[5/20/22, 10:45:09 AM] ‪+91 96431 20943‬: I logged in twice and got a warning.🥲life is unfair.
[5/20/22, 10:45:09 AM] Haya Columbia: Couldn't find an earlier slot but im checking atleast 3 times a day. 
Mostly 5
[5/20/22, 10:45:16 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: U can check in regular intervals i guess, continuously checking will cause issue..
[5/20/22, 10:45:18 AM] Haya Columbia: Then let it be for 24 h
[5/20/22, 10:45:22 AM] Haya Columbia: Yes
[5/20/22, 10:45:44 AM] Haya Columbia: I check as soon as i wake up, and just before I sleep.

Then randomly during the day
[5/20/22, 10:45:57 AM] Haya Columbia: Depends on how many queries you made in those two logins i guess
[5/20/22, 10:46:20 AM] ‪+91 96431 20943‬: Ohh okay.
[5/20/22, 10:46:25 AM] Haya Columbia: Dont refresh the page.
[5/20/22, 10:46:46 AM] Haya Columbia: If you cant access, close it fully and come back after a few min
[5/20/22, 10:47:14 AM] ‪+91 96431 20943‬: Ahh! I refreshed the page 3-4 times. Maybe that’s why.
[5/20/22, 10:47:26 AM] ‪+91 96431 20943‬: Okay! Thankyou!
[5/20/22, 10:47:29 AM] Haya Columbia: No cons whatsoever. 

If you have specific dates, add it.
If you dont know, then add tentative dates.
[5/20/22, 10:48:20 AM] Haya Columbia: It's definitely why. 
A server knows the difference between using the browser refresh button and revisiting a site.
[5/20/22, 10:49:18 AM] ‪+91 98193 54415‬: Does anyone know approximately how long processing takes for a dropbox appointment?
[5/20/22, 10:50:59 AM] Haya Columbia: Upto 3 weeks
[5/20/22, 10:51:09 AM] Haya Columbia: It says anywhere between 1 day and 3 weeks
[5/20/22, 10:51:24 AM] Haya Columbia: Which surprises me because this was touted as being the faster way 🙄🙄🙄
[5/20/22, 10:51:43 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah exactly
[5/20/22, 10:51:45 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s pretty slow
[5/20/22, 10:51:56 AM] Haya Columbia: It's useless man.
[5/20/22, 10:52:05 AM] Haya Columbia: This 30 year old visa system

[5/20/22, 10:53:43 AM] Haya Columbia: Interview is better in ine way because you get a decision on the spot.
[5/20/22, 10:53:59 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah but it’s pretty much the same for Dropbox too
[5/20/22, 10:54:08 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Cause if they accept your passport, it means you’re getting your visa
[5/20/22, 10:54:26 AM] Haya Columbia: But you have to deal with the shit-your-pants stress of talking to people who decide your fate
[5/20/22, 10:54:34 AM] Haya Columbia: Well, sort of
[5/20/22, 10:54:40 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Exactly 😂
[5/20/22, 10:55:01 AM] Haya Columbia: Because at the dropbox location, there's no consular officials.
[5/20/22, 10:55:13 AM] Haya Columbia: It's just VFS (mandatory eye roll for VFS)
[5/20/22, 10:55:40 AM] Haya Columbia: Majority of the times if they take your file, yes you get it.
[5/20/22, 10:55:53 AM] Haya Columbia: Because the agent makes sure everything is in order
[5/20/22, 10:56:15 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp
[5/20/22, 10:56:26 AM] Haya Columbia: But you can still be rejected if the visa officer thinks you're doing some golmaal or if he thinks you're dumb (yes it happens
[5/20/22, 10:56:27 AM] Haya Columbia: )
[5/20/22, 10:56:36 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: 😂

[5/20/22, 11:03:48 AM] Haya Columbia: 1. I dont believe they care about british football league teams. 

2. Who in their right mind supports arsenal?
[5/20/22, 11:03:59 AM] Ankit Gupta: Precisely
[5/20/22, 11:08:32 AM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: i dont think students getting admitted into Columbia are any dumb

[5/20/22, 11:10:36 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Definitely expect more
[5/20/22, 11:11:13 AM] ‪+91 90224 80254‬: After counsular interview, how long until they call us to pick up the passport? Any Idea

[5/20/22, 11:11:40 AM] ‪+91 90224 80254‬: Acha
[5/20/22, 11:11:44 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Also it varies from city to city
[5/20/22, 11:12:40 AM] Haya Columbia: Dont rely on that
[5/20/22, 11:12:49 AM] Haya Columbia: Keep checking status online using your passport number
[5/20/22, 11:13:01 AM] Haya Columbia: Sometimes the message comes late.
[5/20/22, 11:13:09 AM] Haya Columbia: Like days later
[5/20/22, 11:13:59 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah this process is really bad
[5/20/22, 11:21:26 AM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: Did you guys choose Pick-up or Premium Delivery for the Visa documentation delivery? If you chose Pick-up, is the visa handed over immediately after the interview?
[5/20/22, 11:21:45 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Premium Delivery
[5/20/22, 11:22:19 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Nope. After interview you’ll have to wait a few days for the visa to get stamped on your passport. Then you’ll have to go to the consulate to pick it up
[5/20/22, 11:22:35 AM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: Okay thanks!
[5/20/22, 11:22:44 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: 👍🏼

[5/20/22, 11:23:22 AM] Haya Columbia: Delivery. 
Ive been told its safe and the best option
[5/20/22, 11:24:35 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Ok.. for pickup u need to wait for long time at pickup point, i have seen that. 
If delivery is safe then better to save time and opt for it..

[5/20/22, 1:06:08 PM] Haya Columbia: NEFT
[5/20/22, 1:07:05 PM] ‪+91 96431 20943‬: I also did thru NEFT, it took 3hrs.
[5/20/22, 1:07:29 PM] Haya Columbia: That seems to be the case for nearly everyone
[5/20/22, 1:07:32 PM] Haya Columbia: 3-5 hours
[5/20/22, 3:12:45 PM] ‪+91 90224 80254‬: We have to reach before 26th aug right?
[5/20/22, 3:13:03 PM] ‪+91 90224 80254‬: Will 24th landing be ok?
[5/20/22, 3:13:35 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’ll be okay, but you’ll have a harder time settling in and attending the orientations
[5/20/22, 3:14:04 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s preferable to land a week-10 days before 26th

[5/20/22, 8:37:26 PM] Haya Columbia: If you havent submitted it, you can just edit 

If you have submitted it, Create a new ds160, fill it out fully, correctly, then get the AA... number of this new ds160, log in to CGI federal > update profile > update the DS160 number there, save and submit the edit.

[5/24/22, 7:18:23 PM] Ankit Gupta: Guys anyone applied to Education Future scholarship?
[5/24/22, 7:18:25 PM] Ankit Gupta: Is it legit?
[5/24/22, 7:20:16 PM] Haya Columbia: Name sounds like a 90s pyramid scheme lol.
[5/24/22, 7:20:35 PM] Ankit Gupta: It might be which is why I'm asking
[5/24/22, 7:23:18 PM] Haya Columbia: My quick research doesn't create much trust for it
[5/24/22, 7:23:33 PM] Haya Columbia: Most search hits come back to their own page
[5/24/22, 7:23:57 PM] Haya Columbia: And the glowing reciews they have dont seem genuine

[5/24/22, 7:27:37 PM] Haya Columbia: Looks to be a data collection thing my WeMakeScholars.

Users report being pushed or pursued to take loans with we make scholars after signing up for this scholarship
[5/24/22, 7:35:14 PM] Ankit Gupta: I contacted them some time ago.
Here's my findings :
1. Interest rates for loans are low af (Below 9 and above 7)

2. To get the  scholarship (2-10L) I need to get loan sanctioned (what the fuck)

3. Scholarship isn't guaranteed.
4. No fees charged for the process at all.
[5/24/22, 7:36:03 PM] Haya Columbia: Between 7 and 9 isnt low. It's average.
Above average in fact, for student loans.
[5/24/22, 7:36:20 PM] Ankit Gupta: Like I reached the next round, and was told to submit an SOP for the same.
And there is no contact for the scholarship granter just this email id
[5/24/22, 7:36:23 PM] Haya Columbia: 2, i agree. Wtf. 

Which is why I said it seems to be a way to funnel people into WMS loans
[5/24/22, 7:36:29 PM] Haya Columbia: No dont
[5/24/22, 7:36:30 PM] Ankit Gupta: WeMake is a separate organization
[5/24/22, 7:36:36 PM] Haya Columbia: Its not
[5/24/22, 7:36:42 PM] Ankit Gupta: Oh
[5/24/22, 7:36:44 PM] Haya Columbia: This seems to be a subsidy
[5/24/22, 7:37:11 PM] Haya Columbia: Everyone seems to have reached this so called second round
[5/24/22, 7:37:14 PM] Ankit Gupta: And whenever we speak it's always "funded by IT industry... no fees...."

[5/24/22, 7:39:18 PM] Haya Columbia: If giving loans at 7% with 0 fees was profitable, why wouldn't mpower or leap or prodigy do it too?
[5/24/22, 7:39:31 PM] Haya Columbia: And these people defo arent registered as a charity

[5/24/22, 7:40:13 PM] Ankit Gupta: Yeah I'm not taking either
[5/24/22, 7:40:58 PM] Haya Columbia: Check reputed education related companies like topuniversities. For small scholarships

[5/25/22, 1:25:41 PM] ‪+91 77979 93656‬: 86k for premium economy… it doesn’t have economy class anyway … its from mumbai to singapore to new york
[5/25/22, 1:26:30 PM] ‪+91 77979 93656‬: I booked on aug 22 … you can get cheaper on aug 21 from delhi in delta airlines (which is also good) and is through london.
[5/25/22, 1:26:53 PM] ‪+91 77979 93656‬: route through singapore is very very long.
[5/25/22, 1:27:29 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: Did you book through an aggegator or directly through delta?
[5/25/22, 1:28:51 PM] ‪+91 99629 19910‬: @Singapore airline gang gang, did you guys see a meal picking page during the flight booking?
(I'm a vegetarian, so, it's a bit of an issue for me)

[5/25/22, 2:13:27 PM] Rohit Columbia: Delta reviews are not that great for a 14 hour flight 
Singapore is long but is quite comfortable. If you get emirates go for that.

Or is there anyone who took a vaccine, how did you go about it?
[5/25/22, 9:02:18 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: I took the MMR vaccine again. Just had a doctor sign the form they've given with the correct dates along with a proof of vaccination
[5/25/22, 9:02:30 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: They approved it
[5/25/22, 9:03:23 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: As for meningitis, I don't think you need any antibody test. Just proof of vaccination is enough I guess. Please correct me if I'm wrong

[5/25/22, 9:05:19 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: So from what I understand, you took both the vaccines?
[5/25/22, 9:05:36 PM] ‪+91 77589 11100‬: For MMR is it fine if we just get the form signed by a doctor or is it necessary to upload proof of vaccination/tests also?

[5/25/22, 9:14:04 PM] ‪+91 90007 15316‬: Generally go for the preferred name on i20

[5/25/22, 9:59:27 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: yeah, i think its safer to take the booster dose
[5/25/22, 9:59:56 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: but if you can get away without getting one, why trigger your immune response again for no reason 😂

[5/25/22, 11:36:41 PM] ‪+91 94826 93409‬: Hey guys! Need some help with the visa slot booking process. The portal is showing available slots but when I select them, it takes me back to the location selection page. Tried it multiple times and now it's showing me the warning that I had reached my limit and had to logout. How do I avoid this in future ?
[5/25/22, 11:38:15 PM] ‪+91 94826 93409‬: Should I try logging back in or try it tomorrow?
[5/25/22, 11:38:41 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: I took the meningitis vaccine today. Go to your physician, declare your intention to get the vaccine, they will give you a prescription. Use that prescription to buy the vaccine. You may ask your physician to verify if this vaccine is the one you need to get. In my case, I went to the emergency room and explained the situation and asked them to administer the dose and they did. They also marked the date on which they gave me the vaccine on the prescription itself
[5/25/22, 11:44:44 PM] ‪+91 91 6442 684 6‬: I am facing the same issue
[5/25/22, 11:44:55 PM] ‪+91 98694 30357‬: Same issue🤦‍♂️

thinking that it’s an odd hour 
But no luck
[5/25/22, 11:51:51 PM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: After you go to the location selection page, retry with some other location. Worked for me
[5/25/22, 11:52:53 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: They haven't opened up noe
[5/25/22, 11:52:56 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Now
[5/25/22, 11:53:23 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: I guess all the opened slots are booked. Need to wait untill they open up again
[5/25/22, 11:54:14 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: Is there anyone who booked dropbox slots?
[5/25/22, 11:54:35 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Me, but quite a while back
[5/26/22, 12:19:28 AM] ‪+91 98694 30357‬: It's still open for Mumbai. I just booked for june 1 and 7. Changed the network and tried and it worked in one go.
[5/26/22, 12:24:23 AM] ‪+91 70459 93358‬: Is there any way to get past the 12 click limit ?
[5/26/22, 12:26:13 AM] ‪+91 98694 30357‬: Tbh I don't think it's a hard limit because I did three logins and atleast 5-6 ofc-vi loops in each login before I got my slot. But still I didn't get a warning.
[5/26/22, 12:28:17 AM] Adith Columbia: different networks or same networks?
[5/26/22, 12:28:56 AM] ‪+91 98694 30357‬: All failed attempts on one network and as soon as I changed the network it succeeded.

[5/26/22, 10:55:48 AM] ‪+91 90007 15316‬: I don't think so
[5/26/22, 10:55:59 AM] ‪+91 90007 15316‬: The passport adress is generally the temporary adress

[5/26/22, 8:41:24 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Thanks, https://redbus2us.com/visas/usa/renewal/appointment-booking-vac-iw/ seems to suggest that this is normal as well
[5/26/22, 8:42:04 PM] ‪+91 99890 79286‬: Yeah.. even for me it showed like that but once you book the confirmation will say interview waiver
[5/26/22, 8:42:42 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Where did you do your drop off?
[5/26/22, 8:43:02 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yes this is how Dropbox works
[5/26/22, 8:43:13 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Mumbai
[5/26/22, 8:43:58 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: https://ustraveldocs.com/in/en/drop-off-locations indicates we can drop off at non-metro cities. Any idea how that works when appointment scheduling is shown only for the metro VACs?
[5/26/22, 8:49:26 PM] Rohit Columbia: Not sure what you mean by pending tasks. Can you elaborate?
[5/26/22, 8:51:28 PM] ‪+91 98688 52728‬: So basically this is what i see when i login to the oiss portal using my PID. No place to upload my financial documentation.
[5/26/22, 8:52:07 PM] Rohit Columbia: Morningside students should login using the UNI iirc
[5/26/22, 8:52:24 PM] ‪+91 98688 52728‬: When i tried that, i got access denied
[5/26/22, 8:52:44 PM] ‪+91 99890 79286‬: From what I understood, you can schedule the dropbox appointment at some city but you can actually drop it off at any of the 11 or so locations.. but i selected the same location where I dropped off the documents so might be better to check with someone who chose different location on that

[5/26/22, 8:54:55 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: I don't think anyone would risk going to a location other than what is mentioned in the appointment
[5/26/22, 8:56:00 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: 😅
[5/26/22, 8:56:15 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I am going to call them up and clarify if that is allowed.
[5/26/22, 8:56:37 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: Please let us know too if you find something

[5/26/22, 10:16:31 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: no u just need to pay visa fees + i20
[5/26/22, 10:18:24 PM] ‪+91 99721 98521‬: Well the guidelines on the ustraveldocs website said that you need it. Didn't know it was possible without it
[5/26/22, 10:40:01 PM] ‪+91 96620 62572‬: Yes you just need to start the DS160 form and input its number when you book visa slot

[5/26/22, 11:36:31 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It is a loan I think
[5/26/22, 11:36:34 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: They’ve talked about repayment
[5/26/22, 11:36:49 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: I didnt see this anywhere

[5/26/22, 11:43:48 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Yes worth a shot let's see
[5/26/22, 11:47:00 PM] ‪+91 96620 62572‬: If you applied for a loan, it’s to verify and see how many courses you will take and accordingly what will be your tuition so that they can convey to your loan company
[5/26/22, 11:47:25 PM] ‪+91 96620 62572‬: Sorry to break it to you, It’s not a scholarship

[5/27/22, 2:31:34 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Engineering grad acceptance is 28% while the general grad school acceptance is 5.1%. Whatt??
[5/27/22, 2:32:03 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: B school and Laws school are veryyyy selective
[5/27/22, 2:33:31 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Even school of architecture is very selective I guess
[5/27/22, 2:36:37 PM] ‪+91 99701 25325‬: hi all, is anyone choosing Columbia over NYU Courant (MS CS)?
[5/27/22, 2:37:17 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Hmm depends on Course
[5/27/22, 2:37:31 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: For data science I’ve seen people choosing Courant over CU
[5/27/22, 2:51:56 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: You are yet to finalize your university?
[5/27/22, 2:54:03 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes. Is 28 of 100 people who applied to SEAS get accepted and 510 of 50000 people who applied to the uni overall get accepted (so 100 of those 50000 applied to SEAS)

Then it's 5.1% for the uni as a whole and 28% for seas specifically.
[5/27/22, 3:01:15 PM] Adith Columbia: Damn. Csu? 😁😁
[5/27/22, 3:10:28 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: depends course to course some were 6% too this year as well
[5/27/22, 3:10:41 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Oh?
[5/27/22, 3:13:18 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: obviously yes, the number they give on such sites includes the total applications and total admissions , some courses which have over 20% acceptance to compensate there are def some courses which have crazy competition (<6%) hence the aggregate comes to 6-8% for such universities

Will they ask for your previous DS160 in the interview
[5/27/22, 6:28:08 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: So if u submitted ds 160 with mistake, u can create a new one

[5/27/22, 11:36:48 PM] ‪+91 99997 63853‬: Did anyone have a Dropbox appointment?
[5/28/22, 9:33:50 AM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Hi all, I have a doubt regarding the MMR immunization form. Can I get the test done in Delhi and get the form signed by another physician who is working in Hyderabad? I assume the physician only needs test results to sign the form irrespective of where the test is done.
[5/28/22, 9:37:00 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You don’t need to submit the form if you’re doing the tests
[5/28/22, 9:37:08 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: A positive result alone is sufficient
[5/28/22, 9:37:26 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Nonetheless, if you get it signed from a doctor in another city, it should be fine
[5/28/22, 2:06:06 PM] ‪+91 95295 36395‬: Did anyone receive the registration link for summer PDL sessions?

[5/28/22, 4:28:18 PM] ‪+91 90006 54801‬: I got a borderline value for one of the three tests. Does this mean I have to retake the vaccine?
[5/28/22, 4:29:06 PM] ‪+971 52 214 1773‬: Yep, I was in the same situation and had to retake the vaccine !
[5/28/22, 4:29:59 PM] ‪+91 90006 54801‬: 😓 I see. But then do you take two doses?
[5/28/22, 4:30:43 PM] ‪+971 52 214 1773‬: If it’s borderline for measles, then both the doses otherwise one should be sufficient.
[5/28/22, 4:48:51 PM] ‪+91 90006 54801‬: its for rubella so taking vaccine just for it and getting proof for that should be sufficient right?
[5/28/22, 4:49:07 PM] Haya Columbia: My rubella antibodies have work off
[5/28/22, 4:49:18 PM] Haya Columbia: I plan to do the same

[5/29/22, 12:47:26 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: If you have a person as a point of contact then you can choose not to provide that
[5/29/22, 12:48:33 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: I am mentioning the school official name, so can I write Columbia University in that space?
[5/29/22, 12:48:48 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: I guess that works
[5/29/22, 12:49:11 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: In the student section, you’ll be providing points of contact from the university anyways though
[5/29/22, 12:49:33 PM] Ankit Gupta: Yeah 
It's the Herbock woman
I put her name
[5/29/22, 12:49:39 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: I just skipped that, as I entered a person as a point of contact
[5/29/22, 12:50:04 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s different for everyone
[5/29/22, 12:50:26 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: That works
[5/29/22, 12:50:48 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Cool thanks

[5/29/22, 2:46:41 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: It’s included in the amount that you have to pay in the first sem, they upload the bill onto SSOL
[5/29/22, 3:20:30 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Is it mandatory that the US point of contact must be someone from the University? Can it be anyone we know personally?
[5/29/22, 3:21:39 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: For the F1 section it has to be someone at the university
[5/29/22, 3:21:58 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: But for the common section, it can be a personal contact as well
[5/29/22, 3:23:06 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: What are these sections you are referring to?
[5/29/22, 3:23:29 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I am specifically asking about the entry in DS160
[5/29/22, 3:24:10 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yes it has to be someone from university
[5/29/22, 3:31:59 PM] ‪+91 88531 45953‬: Hey! I tried looking there but couldn't find it. Could you point out the section which we should look into?

[5/29/22, 4:30:23 PM] ‪+91 96431 20943‬: When is the fees needed to paid? And is it sem wise or year wise?
[5/29/22, 7:13:45 PM] Rohit Columbia: After registration 
Fee structure depends on the plan 
You can set up a payment plan suitable for you 
You can pay entire fees or pay sem wise or set up a monthly payment plan

[5/31/22, 2:11:02 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Even I’m done but they told me to carry
[5/31/22, 2:11:05 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s safer to carry
[5/31/22, 2:11:44 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: They do have a service available to click photos on site, but it’s better to carry
[5/31/22, 2:12:06 PM] ‪+91 99520 42256‬: Okay, did they ask for the photos?
[5/31/22, 2:12:07 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: I was asked to submit one photograph so better carry with you

[5/31/22, 3:24:19 PM] ‪+91 98111 94870‬: What else are we supposed to carry for the ofc and visa interview? What documents? Someone said if we mention some organisations in the ds form then we need to carry some justification for that sd well. Can somebody pls clarify the procedure?
[5/31/22, 4:06:09 PM] Sinjini Columbia: I didn’t mention any organisation so didn’t carry any documents , just carry the mandatory documents listed
[5/31/22, 7:20:24 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Guys are you joining PDL lectures using your personal mail ID or Columbia mail ID?

[5/31/22, 8:08:06 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You can if you want to. But you cannot find internships in the US
[5/31/22, 8:08:33 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Although she means mostly for current students and not incoming students
[5/31/22, 8:08:36 PM] Ankit Gupta: This is very confusing
Should we apply to internships using their help or what?
[5/31/22, 8:08:37 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: As per my knowledge we can find one till our first year is over. As we can't work off campus for an year after joining

[5/31/22, 8:09:01 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yes

[5/31/22, 8:09:28 PM] Ankit Gupta: So do we apply now?
So the coaches will contact us and then we apply na?
[5/31/22, 8:09:29 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s a condition under the F1 visa
[5/31/22, 8:09:31 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: And prepare us a bit for our interviews
[5/31/22, 8:09:45 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Wait for your coach to contact you
[5/31/22, 8:09:48 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Naa we can't.

[5/31/22, 11:16:35 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Hi, for this question in ds 160, "Have you attended any educational institutions at a secondary level or above?"
Do we need to fill in the details of the 12th and/or 10th standard-related details?
[5/31/22, 11:17:01 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Yeah
[5/31/22, 11:17:16 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: There are some notes on the right hand side on that page
[5/31/22, 11:18:00 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yes enter 12th. If my memory serves me write you have to write “Academic Course” or something along those lines
[5/31/22, 11:18:08 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s given in the right hand side of the page
[5/31/22, 11:18:33 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Same for 10th as well
[5/31/22, 11:26:22 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Alright, thanks
[6/1/22, 12:54:55 AM] ‪+91 98688 52728‬: Could somebody please tell me how i can access the admitted students form and sheet?
[6/1/22, 1:00:23 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Use your Columbia email id to access
[6/1/22, 1:06:17 AM] ‪+91 98688 52728‬: Thank you!
[6/1/22, 2:39:30 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Hey guys, how much funds are you showing/planning to show during visa interview? 1.5 times the i-20 amount?
[6/1/22, 2:40:40 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: And in case of showing funds via family/friends, are you showing some affidavit or a letter of intent or just bank statement?
[6/1/22, 2:41:35 PM] ‪+91 93405 97518‬: Ideally that works, having a bit more is usually considered safer
[6/1/22, 2:42:52 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Okayy
[6/1/22, 2:44:29 PM] ‪+91 90497 30719‬: affidavit of support from parents - yes
[6/1/22, 2:48:05 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Ohh is it this - I-134 form?
[6/1/22, 2:48:18 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Or just sort of plain letter with all details could work?
[6/1/22, 2:49:05 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Even just a plain bank statement works
[6/1/22, 2:49:17 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You don’t necessarily need a letter explicitly stating their intent to support
[6/1/22, 2:49:45 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You can also show the document you submitted to Columbia before obtaining I20 in case you absolutely want to show intent
[6/1/22, 2:49:52 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Because that was essentially the same thing
[6/1/22, 2:50:26 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Ya i guess whatever documents we submitted for i20 same wud suffice right?
[6/1/22, 2:50:32 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp
[6/1/22, 2:50:37 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: Yup
[6/1/22, 2:50:49 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: I just had my visa interview today

[6/1/22, 2:51:06 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: They barely asked me anything
[6/1/22, 2:51:14 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Which consulate?
[6/1/22, 2:51:18 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: Chennai

[6/1/22, 2:54:34 PM] ‪+91 90497 30719‬: I have a list of documents that we need to carry for the VISA interview, that my consultants shared with me, a lot of people have been asking about it so i’ll share it in the group, i hope this helps!
[6/1/22, 2:54:46 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Thanks!
[6/1/22, 2:56:18 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: I had documents for 1.5x but he didn’t ask me the amount he was just like “how are you financing it” 
I told him savings
[6/1/22, 2:56:20 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: And that’s it
[6/1/22, 2:56:33 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: He didn’t ask me anything further
[6/1/22, 2:56:42 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Ohh okayy
[6/1/22, 2:56:46 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Makes sense
[6/1/22, 2:57:09 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Tbh they just want to check that you’re a genuine student and can finance your education
[6/1/22, 2:57:11 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: Tbh 
He started typing my approval after the first question itself
[6/1/22, 2:57:26 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: Yess + the Columbia name really helps a lot
[6/1/22, 2:57:39 PM] ‪+91 94238 86406‬: Did anyone receive yesterday’s PDL session’s slides on their likn mail or personal mail?

[6/1/22, 2:57:51 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: Not yet
[6/1/22, 3:00:58 PM] Srishti Columbia: Is it compulsory that we carry other admit and rejection letters with us ? For the people who already have given their visa interview ^
[6/1/22, 3:01:29 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: I would say carry your admit letters
[6/1/22, 3:01:45 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You can, but they usually just verbally ask
[6/1/22, 3:02:12 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: Admit letters from other universities?
[6/1/22, 3:02:39 PM] Ankit Gupta: Will they add weight?
[6/1/22, 3:02:48 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: Ya that’s what
[6/1/22, 3:03:24 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It can sometimes be a pressure point because they might ask “Why Columbia and not some other uni”
[6/1/22, 3:08:31 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: It's safer to carry it. Honestly they barely ever ask for documents. They'll question you about it tho, like how many unis did you apply to, admits/rejects. So before the interview just remember the college names and courses that you applied to that's all.
[6/1/22, 3:08:59 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp exactly
[6/1/22, 3:09:04 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: Yupp
[6/1/22, 3:10:03 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: I'd recommend carry all the docs mentioned in the lists. It just gives you a confidence booster like "I'm prepared for everything"
[6/1/22, 3:10:18 PM] Srishti Columbia: Okay thank you !
[6/1/22, 3:10:33 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: And confidence is what they majorly look for.
[6/1/22, 3:11:33 PM] Haya Columbia: Guy from embassy said in a webinar "we generally just want to look at your i20 and your sevis record and hear you talk for a couple minutes"
[6/1/22, 3:15:45 PM] ‪+91 80508 96195‬: Hi guys
I was wondering if there’s anyone here who has/had a Dropbox appointment in Chennai VAC?
[6/1/22, 3:21:20 PM] Haya Columbia: I have one.
[6/1/22, 3:21:23 PM] Haya Columbia: End of june
[6/1/22, 3:31:34 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Ya i remember the guy saying this..
[6/1/22, 3:32:01 PM] Haya Columbia: The QS thing?
[6/1/22, 3:36:06 PM] ‪+971 52 214 1773‬: Hey guys! Do we need our old passport for the visa ?
[6/1/22, 3:36:18 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s best to carry
[6/1/22, 3:36:28 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Especially if you have an old US visa
[6/1/22, 3:36:43 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: But even then, they often check your travel history so it’s best to carry
[6/1/22, 3:36:44 PM] Haya Columbia: If you have US visas in any of them, yes
[6/1/22, 3:36:53 PM] Haya Columbia: If you dont, no but still carry them
[6/1/22, 3:37:06 PM] Ankit Gupta: just wondering do they ask for your docs one by one or expect you to show them all together?
Unless asked is it needed to show old passports?

[6/2/22, 10:15:30 PM] ‪+91 98694 30357‬: Hey Guys, does anyone have siblings who might have gone on f1 and now working there on h1b? Any idea what could be probable questions in the visa interview regarding the same and how to tackle them effectively?
[6/2/22, 11:11:38 PM] Haya Columbia: They'll ask what's the guarantee you'll come back and won't stay there
[6/2/22, 11:12:01 PM] Haya Columbia: Idk what to say tho unless you have a job offer outside US afterwards
[6/2/22, 11:15:34 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: If your parents own some property you can just take that to show ties to home country. Say you have investments here.
[6/2/22, 11:18:45 PM] ‪+91 82798 03383‬: Guys, do we need to get parent's signature as well on I20 or is it only for those below the age of 18?

[6/3/22, 8:06:14 PM] Ankit Gupta: Mention Linkedin atleast that would be fine

[6/3/22, 8:08:22 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: If you purposely hide, and they find out somehow, then it’s grounds for visa refusal
[6/3/22, 8:08:31 PM] Haya Columbia: Not social media man
[6/3/22, 8:08:40 PM] Haya Columbia: Reddit is anonymous for a reason
[6/3/22, 8:08:53 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Damn, I screwed up then
[6/3/22, 8:08:54 PM] Haya Columbia: You can share whatever you want. Everything can be found using your name anyway

[6/3/22, 8:13:14 PM] Haya Columbia: In the US, saying that itself is considered like anti gun and hence divisive or whatever
[6/3/22, 8:13:20 PM] Haya Columbia: 🤦‍♂️
[6/3/22, 8:13:27 PM] Haya Columbia: Dont do it now.
[6/3/22, 8:13:33 PM] Haya Columbia: Since you've already given it
[6/3/22, 8:13:59 PM] Ankit Gupta: @919958692123 it's better to make your account private or delete comments

[6/3/22, 8:18:37 PM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: 🤞
[6/3/22, 8:18:44 PM] Haya Columbia: Cos like, no one who has anything to hide is gonna share it in the first place
[6/3/22, 8:35:04 PM] Ankit Gupta: If you're a redditor you have everything to hide

[6/4/22, 8:15:43 PM] Vriddhi Columbia: If the location on the DS160 is different from the Visa interview or Ofc location, is that a problem?
[6/4/22, 8:16:04 PM] ‪+91 82966 12489‬: Nope
[6/4/22, 8:16:38 PM] Vriddhi Columbia: So no need to change the DS 160 na?

[6/4/22, 8:27:03 PM] ‪+91 96057 35922‬: Is it okay to do NEFT payment for visa interview at night also? Will it reflect within 3-4 hours or will I have to wait till Monday?
[6/4/22, 8:27:28 PM] Vriddhi Columbia: But is it required xD

[6/5/22, 1:10:21 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Hi, can anyone share the documents that we need to carry for the biometric appointment?
[6/5/22, 1:24:33 PM] Srishti Columbia: Visa confirmation 
Passport 
DS-160 confirmation 

They only see these three documents, but it's safe to carry I-20, Sevis fee receipt along with you too.
[6/5/22, 1:27:25 PM] ‪+91 76193 59184‬: You definitely need to take your signed I-20 and the SEVIS fee receipt
[6/5/22, 3:52:24 PM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: No that’s for interview
[6/5/22, 3:52:29 PM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: This is correct
[6/5/22, 3:52:59 PM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: But carry the i20 and sevis payment confirmation. They will only tell you before you enter that you don’t need it
[6/5/22, 3:53:31 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: For me for dropbox they asked a copy of I-20
[6/5/22, 3:53:41 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Same
[6/5/22, 3:53:44 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: And SEVIS fee payment
[6/5/22, 3:55:48 PM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: Question was asked for biometric appointment

[6/8/22, 2:44:42 PM] ‪+91 94272 19717‬: I don’t think so they’ve mentioned anything about booster dose
[6/8/22, 2:45:25 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s not as of now but they’ll update their policy soon
[6/8/22, 2:45:26 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Or they’ll make you take it there
[6/8/22, 2:45:28 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s best if you take now
[6/8/22, 2:46:14 PM] ‪+91 88600 57584‬: Is it okay if I’m not eligible for it yet? 
Like my second dose of covishield was on the 1st of May!

[6/8/22, 2:46:51 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Govt allows students to take the booster on the basis of their destination country
[6/8/22, 2:47:21 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: yes that's fine, but if it's before going , better to take it and go
[6/8/22, 2:48:09 PM] ‪+91 88600 57584‬: Oh okay! Thanks!
Do you think need to have an explanation regarding why I took the second dose this late? 
Or it doesn’t matter?

[6/8/22, 2:49:25 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: take the dose now, or show immunity against it via test
[6/8/22, 2:49:50 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: What's the source for this information? Also Covaxin/Covishield are both WHO approved so that won't be an issue right? (I've taken 2 doses of Covaxin)

[6/8/22, 2:50:30 PM] ‪+91 99112 32286‬: Since I have taken the doses
[6/8/22, 2:51:24 PM] ‪+91 98200 74016‬: You may have to take the doses regardless. I did - some people just dont retain antibodies
[6/8/22, 2:51:28 PM] ‪+91 98200 74016‬: For MMR ie

Hepatitis B titre tests(surface antigen and antibody)

Varicella IGg titre test 
TB t-spot

Did anyone of you take all of these? If yes, from where?
I’m from Delhi, so any specific detail would be appreciated.

[6/8/22, 2:57:04 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: it's from the beginning
[6/8/22, 2:57:16 PM] ‪+91 91 76671 333‬: Is it enough if doctor signs a document saying we have taken the necessary vaccines….or is it necessary to take the antibody test
[6/8/22, 2:57:17 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: SEAS students need MMR and COVID 
Thats it
[6/8/22, 2:57:49 PM] ‪+91 88600 57584‬: Right!
Being from a medical course, we will be dealing with patients, so there are additional requirements for us!
[6/8/22, 2:59:31 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: Gangaram Hospital, Karol Bagh, Delhi.
MMR and Meningitis are available there. You can ask them about others as well.

I went to lalpathlabs today but for some reason they weren’t too confident with the antibodies tests! They weren’t sure which ones in specific I should go for and since they were expensive, they asked me to go to some other place! So I came back disappointed. Anyone who has any leads, pls DM me.

Maybe additional requirements for you because hospital and all kinds of vaccination you need !
[6/8/22, 3:06:59 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: I saw someone came to me asking about this (now I’m doubtful about whether it was sps or surgery thing. I’ll recheck)

[6/8/22, 3:19:14 PM] Rohit Columbia: Sometimes they add igM tests as well when we mostly require only the igg and costs go up.
If you have the exact test details, make sure to enquire the tests before you take them.
[6/8/22, 3:20:09 PM] Rohit Columbia: We had shared an email chain last month 
I couldn't find it in history 
If somebody else could find it please post 
Else I will reshare the chain

You can check the coulmbia website
[6/8/22, 3:22:10 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Thanks Man. Anyways the Cowin website also says I have a pending precaution aka booster dose. So it just makes sense to take the booster.
[6/8/22, 3:22:26 PM] ‪+91 94238 86406‬: Titer test can be left black for mmr right?
[6/8/22, 3:22:35 PM] ‪+91 70226 58903‬: If we have taken the vaccines, we don't have to take the antibody test, right?
[6/8/22, 3:22:37 PM] ‪+91 94238 86406‬: If you have that form signed and you enter your dates
[6/8/22, 3:22:38 PM] ‪+91 88600 57584‬: At this point the price is not issue, but those guys themselves were like that these are expensive and in case it’s not the one you’d want, it will be a mess! 

The document that I’ve shared above mentions the details of the tests, but lalpath had like 4-5 tests options for each so we all got confused eventually!
[6/8/22, 3:23:15 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Take IGG tests

[6/8/22, 3:24:19 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: My doc recommended the IGG tests for MMR
[6/8/22, 3:24:46 PM] ‪+91 88600 57584‬: Yes the titre tests are usually iGg tests unless asked specially to show IgM
[6/8/22, 3:24:57 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Correct
[6/8/22, 3:25:14 PM] ‪+91 88600 57584‬: Lalpath had like 2-3 iGg tests so idk

[6/8/22, 6:29:02 PM] Haya Columbia: So its fine
[6/8/22, 6:29:16 PM] ‪+91 94442 28101‬: Ohh right! Thank you!! ☺️
[6/8/22, 6:36:17 PM] Ankit Gupta: Within 30 days yeah?
[6/8/22, 6:37:00 PM] Haya Columbia: The start date of your visa is 30 days prior to course start date on i20
[6/8/22, 6:37:03 PM] Haya Columbia: Thats what i meant

[6/8/22, 6:37:39 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: How
[6/8/22, 6:37:50 PM] Haya Columbia: This is always determined by the immigration officer at the airport of entry to the US
[6/8/22, 6:38:38 PM] Haya Columbia: So for us student visas, they're basically a permit to TRAVEL to the us.

Whether or not you can enter and how long you stay is determined by the guy who stamps your passpport when you get off the flight
[6/8/22, 6:38:44 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Different people can stay in the US for different years?
[6/8/22, 6:38:57 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: 🤔😬🥴
[6/8/22, 6:39:00 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes
For students its usually based on course length
[6/8/22, 6:39:07 PM] Haya Columbia: Simply its this way
[6/8/22, 6:39:16 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Is there discrimination
[6/8/22, 6:39:17 PM] Haya Columbia: Keep your i20 with you when you travel to us
[6/8/22, 6:39:28 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Or all students are treated equally
[6/8/22, 6:39:38 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Will do what else?
[6/8/22, 6:39:40 PM] Haya Columbia: At the gate, you show that and they'll stamp you on till that daye
[6/8/22, 6:39:50 PM] Haya Columbia: *immigration counter (not gat)
[6/8/22, 6:40:00 PM] Haya Columbia: *gate

[6/8/22, 6:40:10 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Hahahaha dw!
[6/8/22, 6:40:22 PM] Haya Columbia: Mostly for student visas its all the same unless something flags up your passport or something.
[6/8/22, 6:40:27 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: The validity of the visa is usually 5 years though
[6/8/22, 6:40:38 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Oh
[6/8/22, 6:40:42 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: On your visa the expiry date written will be after 5 years

[6/8/22, 6:40:56 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: After entry

[6/8/22, 6:41:05 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: No 😂

[6/8/22, 6:41:36 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: So you’ll have your OPT that will start after course completion
[6/8/22, 6:41:39 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Exactly
[6/8/22, 6:41:45 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Isn’t it 2 years
[6/8/22, 6:41:50 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: For STEM programs?
[6/8/22, 6:41:52 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: So the I-20 is valid for the duration of the course
[6/8/22, 6:41:52 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Otherwise they are gonna deport you
[6/8/22, 6:41:55 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: No
[6/8/22, 6:42:02 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Then after that your OPT starts
[6/8/22, 6:42:09 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: During which you have 2 months to get a job
[6/8/22, 6:42:24 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: After THAT you have three years to work without an H1B on the basis of OPT
[6/8/22, 6:42:36 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Yes
[6/8/22, 6:42:40 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: But you need to have a job within 2 months after your OPT period starts
[6/8/22, 6:42:48 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Got it
[6/8/22, 6:42:50 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Perfect

Date : 6thJune
Slot : 10:00
In: 9:30

University : University of New Haven
Vo : old american guy (around 60’s)
Status:  Rejected 😞

Me : GM officer
Vo : No response
Vo : i20 , passport
Me : given
Vo: Why USA
Me:  to pursue masters in data science at university of New Haven
Vo: whats your CGPA
Me: 8.86/10
Vo:  When did you complete your bachelors
Me: 2016
Vo: whats your wrk experience 
Me: 5.5 years as senior research engineer in xx company
Vo : You can continue your work. I am rejecting your visa


Note: He rejected four people in-front of me and questions were almost same


I hope no one encounters him
[6/8/22, 7:08:53 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Check if the option is available in “Update Profile” or if the option isn’t there then give it through “Provide Feedback”
[6/8/22, 7:10:25 PM] ‪+91 98200 74016‬: Ouch. That is cold.
[6/8/22, 7:10:45 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Damn
[6/8/22, 7:10:57 PM] ‪+91 91 6040 500 6‬: Bruh
[6/8/22, 7:11:09 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Well his “Why USA” answer was very vague
[6/8/22, 7:11:28 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: And he had too much work experience without justification to go for a masters
[6/8/22, 7:11:47 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Also, uni is University of New Haven
[6/8/22, 7:11:50 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Yeah
[6/8/22, 7:11:57 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: The name of the university plays a huge role as well. I don't
[6/8/22, 7:12:10 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Think that columbia students are gonna face that problem
[6/8/22, 7:12:19 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: +1
[6/8/22, 7:12:22 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp
[6/8/22, 7:12:37 PM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: I think the answer to the question "Why USA ?" is incorrect and not proper. He asked about why you have selected USA as a country to complete your master's and not what you're going to do after coming to USA.
[6/8/22, 7:12:52 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: GPA was good. So was work ex. Probably uni didn't match creds.
[6/8/22, 7:13:22 PM] Ankit Gupta: New Haven sounds like a place in GTA IV
[6/8/22, 7:13:46 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: I swear 😂

I'm receiving dms about it 😅🤦🏻‍♂️
[6/8/22, 7:13:54 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes absolutely
[6/8/22, 7:14:32 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah exactly
[6/8/22, 7:14:37 PM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: Ohh😅😂 
He has just shared an experience

Then submit and from the home page go to appt conf again and regenerate the pdf
[6/8/22, 7:34:09 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: If someone had applied to universities outside the US or avoided them for a reason, can you guys mention why you chose a US University over them? I never even checked Universities in other countries, so I really don't have an idea 😬
[6/8/22, 7:34:16 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: It would be interesting hear your perspective
[6/8/22, 7:35:17 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: First of all, language barrier
[6/8/22, 7:35:26 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: *possible language barrier
[6/8/22, 7:35:53 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Then you could say that the education in US is much more hands on and practical as compared to Europe, which suits your career needs
[6/8/22, 7:36:01 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: 2 reasons is enough
[6/8/22, 7:42:09 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: at least in europe you can work part time in actual companies and study .. so it's practical in that aspect
[6/8/22, 7:45:21 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: No, he’s asking why unis in US are better
[6/8/22, 7:45:39 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: i know. but im commenting on your statement
[6/8/22, 7:45:46 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Aah okay
[6/8/22, 7:45:57 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah that’s true but the VO doesn’t know that
[6/8/22, 7:46:11 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You just need to convince the VO
[6/8/22, 7:47:31 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Why do I feel decisions are taken before the interview
[6/8/22, 7:47:46 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Interview is maybe 10% of overall acceptance or rejection decision
[6/8/22, 7:48:59 PM] ‪+91 72598 46039‬: My experience:

Location: Chennai
Date: 8th June
Slot: 11:30AM
University: Columbia University in the City of New York
Counter: 27 (African-American bald guy)
Status: Approved

After initial salutations and proactively handing over the i20, SEVIS fee receipt and passport cause he didn’t ask, he started typing

VO: Which university are you planning to attend?
Me: Columbia University in the City of New York

VO: Which course are you going for?
Me: Master’s in Computer Science

VO: Which all universities did you apply to?
Me: Listed out only a couple, not even the whole list.

VO: And obviously Columbia is the best cause it’s Ivy League right?
Me: Haha yeah

VO: Are you working at some IT company or something?
Me: I’m working at Amazon, been working here for the past 2 years.

After some silence and typing
VO: So you lived in Tokyo?
(Context: my prev US visa was issued from Tokyo which I had entered in my DS-160)
Me: Yes, for 3 years when I was very young. Went there because of my dad’s job (explained a bit about the job) and that’s where my last US visa was issued. We had visited US then on a pleasure trip.

VO started talking to me in Japanese 😂
I said I don’t remember any cause I was too young xD
He then laughed and then asked me to place my right 4 fingers on the scanner and handed me a green slip saying that my visa was approved.

Tips:
1. Be confident and conversational. Can be informal yet respectful.
2. Sometimes it’s hard to hear the VO with all the other interviews going on in other counters. I had to bring my ear closer to hear him. You can always ask him to repeat his question politely as well.
3. Don’t even listen to other interviews around you and get distracted, just focus on your own.
4. Listen carefully to what the VO is asking and answer accordingly. You can even take a short pause to think before answering.
5. Make sure to practice with a couple of questions, actually say them out loud when you are. It helps build confidence.

Any would do, right?

[6/9/22, 11:28:14 AM] ‪+91 96431 20943‬: Anyone here knows how to change the document delivery after giving the interview?
[6/9/22, 11:29:57 AM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: you cant
[6/9/22, 12:38:54 PM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: Yes, we can. There's an option "Change Document Delivery Information” on the dashboard through which it's possible. I even received email from ustraveldocs regarding this
[6/9/22, 12:39:27 PM] ‪+91 94238 86406‬: Login into ustraveldocs account
[6/9/22, 12:39:39 PM] ‪+91 94238 86406‬: I think you will find steps on home page itself
[6/9/22, 12:41:48 PM] Haya Columbia: You can but i wouldn't recommend it.
[6/9/22, 12:41:54 PM] Haya Columbia: These systems are terrible
[6/9/22, 12:42:02 PM] Haya Columbia: Who know when they update their view on their end
[6/9/22, 12:43:59 PM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: Yeah that's true. As per them, they want us to go for Premium delivery due to the increasing Covid cases and safety of applicants.
[6/9/22, 12:45:39 PM] Haya Columbia: And yk. You have to wait in the sun to pick it up anyway and the most you'll save is one business day with pickup
[6/9/22, 12:45:53 PM] Haya Columbia: My dad said he's used delivery every time and its always been fine for him
[6/9/22, 12:46:20 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: The pickup is terrible, my friend had to wait for 4 hours inside the office.
[6/9/22, 12:46:33 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp premium really fine
[6/9/22, 12:46:36 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: *is really fine
[6/9/22, 12:47:13 PM] ‪+91 82798 03383‬: Do they send a tracking id when they dispatch the passport?
[6/9/22, 12:47:36 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Didn’t send one to me
[6/9/22, 12:49:55 PM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: That's why they're suggesting to go for premium delivery maybe
[6/9/22, 12:50:42 PM] ‪+91 98985 74949‬: What to put under course of study in DS-160 form?
Major mentioned in I-20 or program name?
[6/9/22, 12:51:03 PM] Haya Columbia: I think if its same city you just get "dispatched" and "delivered"
[6/9/22, 12:51:07 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: better to give as per i20
[6/9/22, 12:51:11 PM] Haya Columbia: No need of tracking id for that 😅
[6/9/22, 12:51:38 PM] ‪+91 97696 69246‬: Anyone doing masters in management science and engineering? 
A friend wanted to connect for a few questions he had so lmk if you’re open to it
[6/9/22, 12:51:50 PM] ‪+91 98985 74949‬: Ok
[6/9/22, 12:51:54 PM] Haya Columbia: They always push for it.
It's just to prevent people crowding up.

And also they have tieups with the courier companies, so they get that sweet commission
[6/9/22, 12:52:11 PM] Haya Columbia: You can give as per i20 or admit letter
[6/9/22, 12:52:16 PM] Haya Columbia: I gave as per admit letter

[6/9/22, 12:53:45 PM] Haya Columbia: My i20 says "electrical and electronics engineering"

My admit says "electrical engineering"
[6/9/22, 12:53:53 PM] Haya Columbia: So it doesnt make a difference in my case
[6/9/22, 12:54:03 PM] Haya Columbia: But ig if its very different, you can make the call
[6/9/22, 12:54:04 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Put address per I20

[6/9/22, 1:10:06 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: I went for pickup in Mumbai since the consulate is very close to my house. Was in and out in less than 5 mintues. I'd recommend pickup in Mumbai if you live near the consulate also you get it within 2 days of the interview if you're picking it up.

[6/10/22, 10:45:12 AM] Ankit Gupta: Try doing Imps if possible as well
[6/10/22, 10:45:28 AM] ‪+91 94442 28101‬: Ohh okay! So once I do the NEFT payment, I’ll get a receipt number? Is that it?

[6/10/22, 11:05:09 AM] ‪+91 81237 99849‬: It was mostly about applying emotional intelligence (one of the top skills required at work),  stepping into others shoes and understanding their story.

Not getting triggered by people at work, start counting instead.

Learning to manage emotions.

And they also suggested a set of books.

[6/10/22, 11:56:25 AM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: Parent's signature is not required if you're 18+
[6/10/22, 11:56:50 AM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: I guess you should be 18+😅😂

I'm opting out
[6/10/22, 12:31:33 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: yes
[6/10/22, 12:32:00 PM] Adith Columbia: I opted out and my holds got cleared. It's no stress.
[6/10/22, 12:33:11 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: Can we opt out now and take it at Columbia?
[6/10/22, 12:33:34 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: yes
[6/10/22, 12:34:21 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: Do we have to fill out any form for that? Or is it walk in
[6/10/22, 12:35:15 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: I think you register for the vaccine through the health portal once you go to Columbia
[6/10/22, 12:41:42 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: Any idea if it’s covered by insurance?
[6/10/22, 12:42:07 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah I remember reading certain vaccines were covered… this was one of them I think
[6/10/22, 12:42:26 PM] Ankit Gupta: What all is covered by insurance could someone send a link of sorts😅
[6/10/22, 12:42:30 PM] Ankit Gupta: Or a rough idea
[6/10/22, 12:44:07 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: My pediatrician recommended taking it here, she said in case it's not covered by your university insurance it's gonna be hella expensive in the US.
[6/10/22, 12:44:24 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: +1
[6/10/22, 12:45:12 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Plus if you have any side effects it’s better to deal with them here
[6/10/22, 12:45:20 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: Yes same but it’s apparently covered by Columbia health insurance if you take it at the student centre and wanna save 5k here..
[6/10/22, 12:45:21 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Don’t delay your vaccinations to the US
[6/10/22, 12:46:53 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Makes sense, let's email them and check and make sure that's it's covered. I also haven't taken it yet.
[6/10/22, 12:47:50 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: We could still send a mail asking this question to get an idea.
[6/10/22, 12:48:33 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: If someone was able to find it on the website itself then it would be helpful if they could provide the link

[6/10/22, 3:38:17 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Haven't taken it yet because I just took the MMR vaacine and my doc told me to wait for a bit before taking the Meningitis vaccine.

[6/10/22, 5:22:11 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: It should, I'm not too sure tho, if anyone has done it can you please confirm.
[6/10/22, 5:22:19 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Hey guys, a few questions about ds-160 form - 
1. The length of the stay we have kept around 16-18 months. As per i-20 it is 16 months right?
2. Did you mention the previous phone numbers ( the question in which they ask if you had any other phone numbers in last 5 years ) 
3. On the same page, did you mention all your email addresses?
4. I know there was some discussion about social media handles and what I understand we are mostly giving some of them like LinkedIn, Facebook etc right?
5. Does anyone ever lost/got their passports stolen, how you adding this information, like in reason how much you are elaborating?
6. In case of people who are working, what did you give as your companies phone number? Some specific person's contact?
7. Did you add all your internships during university?
(Sorry for so many of them :/ )
[6/10/22, 5:24:26 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yes it will
[6/10/22, 5:25:37 PM] Ankit Gupta: 1. Write 16 months
2. I doubt it's needed unless you still hold them
3. No need to mention all email IDs, they really won't care
4. Some of us have really questionable search history on reddit, tumblr and pinterest so only give Linkedin or at best FB
5. That's upto you
6. You can give a company contact, however it's upto you
7. Yes or no that's your choosing
[6/10/22, 5:26:00 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: For 7 I did add
[6/10/22, 5:26:16 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: 5. I lost both of my old passports. I mentioned that I lost them during the house renovation.
[6/10/22, 5:29:40 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Ohhokayy makes sense, thank you :))!!
[6/10/22, 5:37:03 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: What should be the point of contact im DS 160 ?
[6/10/22, 5:37:20 PM] Ankit Gupta: school official mentioned on your i20
[6/10/22, 5:37:24 PM] Ankit Gupta: look in the 2nd page for a signature
[6/10/22, 5:37:25 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: We need to mention 2 on the form
[6/10/22, 5:37:34 PM] Ankit Gupta: eh
[6/10/22, 5:37:39 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Who would be the 2nd one
[6/10/22, 5:38:18 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: all answers pretty much covered by @918618891003 ,

related to Q7) in the last section, many who haven't filled ds 160 yet / who don't know.. u don't have to mention Columbia University incoming student etc there.. the section is to understand what you currently are doing...
so people who are working can enter 
Work related info -> Undergrad details ( education part) -> Add another education section for 12 th standard info.

or if recently graduated in 2022
 mention you are student ( undergrad details ) -> in experience section can give details about 1 internship that's related to your future course of study in masters else not needed 
-> give 12 th standard info

or if you have been unemployed but have graduated earlier

mention courses you took up, break to study for gre toefl etc exams -> internship during undegrad in work ex section -> and 12 th standard info

10th info is not required however no issue if u mention it.
[6/10/22, 5:38:56 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: this is the last section where in u need to give info of 2 points of contact in your residence country
[6/10/22, 5:39:45 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Ohh
[6/10/22, 5:39:46 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: everyone pls ask ur questions completely with screenshots if possible, most of the folks might get confused sharing half info and end up answering incorrectly
[6/10/22, 5:40:14 PM] Ankit Gupta: yeah you can give your neighbours or anyone you know who's not related to you
[6/10/22, 5:41:03 PM] Ankit Gupta: :who can vouch for you, that is 😅
[6/10/22, 5:41:48 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Yup got it, thanks for the quick response
[6/10/22, 5:42:14 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Or friends also we can give right? Who are living in other states?
[6/10/22, 5:42:54 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: other states in home residence ( India) , yes

[6/10/22, 5:53:32 PM] ‪+91 84529 48554‬: If I’ve filled my UG details only in the education section and not the 12th details, then Would it be ok ? 
Ps. I’ve submitted the form.
[6/10/22, 5:57:31 PM] ‪+91 99997 63853‬: +1
[6/10/22, 6:22:12 PM] Haya Columbia: Ik it's already been answered but I'm gonna answer again just for a larger dataset lol.

1. 16 months
2. I provided all my active numbers, yes. This is mainly used, like social media and email, to check your history and intent and stuff.
3. I only gave my primary email amd my current work email. The rest are for junk, subscriptions, or are inactive work/school accounts etc. 
4. LinkedIn, FB, and maybe insta if you are really inclined is enough. They just mainly want to know you are who you say you are. 
5. The geberal rulr of thumb with US visa procedures is don't volunteer unnecessary info. Upto you how much you wanna write but I recommend keeping it succinct. (Like "passport stolen during vacation. Loss registered with local police and and passport issuing authority notified" is sufficient imo)
[6/10/22, 6:24:52 PM] Haya Columbia: 6. I gave my manager's work-mobile number. 
You can also give the helpdesk or switchboard or your own deskphone too if you wish.

7. Yes I did, I wouldn't recommend leaving anything out unless its highly irrelevant (like for example, wrt work exp, they wont be mad you left out your role in volunteering at a local orphanage. But say you did an internship with a molitary contractor and left it out, and the VO found out, youd be in deep poop)
[6/10/22, 6:25:51 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: This should also be ok right ? I mean I haven't notified any authority because they are old passports
[6/10/22, 6:25:55 PM] Haya Columbia: If this is the near the last section, I gave one neighbour and a senior colleague at work.
[6/10/22, 6:26:23 PM] Haya Columbia: You always must notify the issuing authority if you lose a passport. Expired or not
[6/10/22, 6:26:53 PM] Haya Columbia: If its expired, they'll just register as expired across their systems. If its active, they have to issue you a new one
[6/10/22, 6:27:22 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Oh ok it's expired. Any idea, how long does it take if I notify them now ?
[6/10/22, 6:27:28 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Internships are also only required if done after graduation
[6/10/22, 6:27:54 PM] Haya Columbia: I dont know whether it will be an issue in your us visa process tho
[6/10/22, 6:28:23 PM] Haya Columbia: You may want to look this up online or ask an agent or someone. I have no experience with lost passports
[6/10/22, 6:29:02 PM] Haya Columbia: Honestly, not sure. Check the passport seva website
[6/10/22, 6:29:22 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: I asked someone from leap, and they said only mention on DS-160 if an active passport was lost
[6/10/22, 6:29:22 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Oh ok thanks. I will check there
[6/10/22, 6:29:24 PM] Haya Columbia: Oh i wasnt aware of this.

I gave mine anyway cos its relevant to my field
[6/10/22, 6:29:40 PM] Haya Columbia: It depends ig. 
If you had an old us visa
[6/10/22, 6:30:00 PM] Haya Columbia: If you didn't then the visa people dont care about older passports
[6/10/22, 6:30:27 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Then also, it only matters if you lost ot while the Visa was active
[6/10/22, 6:30:30 PM] Haya Columbia: I personally wouldn't trust leap. But yeah. Depends on whether he had a visa in the lost passport
[6/10/22, 6:30:46 PM] Haya Columbia: No no. You need to show all  old US visas
[6/10/22, 6:30:51 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: I don't have any US Visa in both of them
[6/10/22, 6:30:52 PM] Haya Columbia: When applying for a new us visa
[6/10/22, 6:30:54 PM] Haya Columbia: Every time
[6/10/22, 6:31:05 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: In the lost section?
[6/10/22, 6:31:16 PM] Haya Columbia: At the dropbox or interview
[6/10/22, 6:32:15 PM] Haya Columbia: Then i dont think its an issue for you as far as this visa process is concerned
[6/10/22, 6:32:38 PM] Haya Columbia: You have to produce the older passports that have US visas
[6/10/22, 6:32:44 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: My Biometric is on Sunday. So should I just fill a DS-160 without mentioning them ?
[6/10/22, 6:33:02 PM] Haya Columbia: Where have you mentioned the rn
[6/10/22, 6:33:15 PM] Haya Columbia: Send me a picture hiding all sensitive info
[6/10/22, 6:33:28 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: I mentioned them in lost passport section
[6/10/22, 6:33:29 PM] Haya Columbia: Also, I recommend calling US travel docs helpline
[6/10/22, 6:33:39 PM] Haya Columbia: Call them now and ask the callcentre this question
[6/10/22, 6:34:07 PM] Rohit Columbia: I don't think the call center would answer this question
[6/10/22, 6:34:33 PM] Haya Columbia: They are supposed to answer all questions regarding visa application.

[6/10/22, 7:04:44 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: But do they ask about internships in interview?
[6/10/22, 7:04:54 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Or its mostly abt the finances and college
[6/10/22, 7:06:14 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: They just might ask about relevant work experience to your masters but internships specifically I haven't heard about.
[6/10/22, 7:06:35 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Work experience as in job right??

[6/10/22, 7:06:53 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: They ask about internships if you tell them you’ve done one

[6/10/22, 7:07:03 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Yeah i didnt have any job thats why i left it out
[6/10/22, 7:07:07 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: They’ll ask if you have any work experience
[6/10/22, 7:07:13 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: If you say “internship” they’ll ask
[6/10/22, 7:07:27 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: I will just reply with a no
[6/10/22, 7:07:36 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp

Or self-owned estabilishments?
[6/10/22, 7:07:52 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Internships count I think

[6/10/22, 7:11:36 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: But i didnt mention them as work exp in my ds160
[6/10/22, 7:12:23 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Don’t think they’re that vital to whether you get a visa or not tbh
[6/10/22, 7:12:31 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: So don’t worry
[6/10/22, 7:12:37 PM] ‪+91 96620 62572‬: Doesn’t matter that much
[6/10/22, 7:12:47 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Ok thanks a lot
[6/10/22, 7:19:18 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: For 2 its ok not to.
[6/10/22, 7:25:27 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Ok I have a doubt. It should already be registered as expired right ? So, what difference does it make if I report it or not ? Also, I was a minor when those passports were issued.
[6/10/22, 7:28:09 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: You have to file FIR if you lose your passport regardless of its status
[6/10/22, 7:29:10 PM] Haya Columbia: I dont know. Probably to prevent fraud. (Even expred passports can be misused)
All i know is it needs to be reported expored or not. 

It's upto you though i guess. I genuinely dont know the implications of this in your us visa application because you dont have any expired US visas in those lost passports
[6/10/22, 7:29:23 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes. Thats what i know as the law.
[6/10/22, 7:29:35 PM] Haya Columbia: File *LDR
[6/10/22, 7:29:47 PM] Haya Columbia: (Lost document report)
[6/10/22, 7:29:59 PM] Haya Columbia: Check your state poloce website on guidance for this
[6/10/22, 7:30:11 PM] Haya Columbia: And you also have to report to passport sewa
[6/10/22, 7:30:11 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: That is that 🥲
I just used common term
[6/10/22, 7:34:04 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Ok actually I would have done it if I had time, but my biometric is on Sunday. So I am a bit confused right now
[6/10/22, 7:35:06 PM] Haya Columbia: Gimme 5
[6/10/22, 7:35:12 PM] Haya Columbia: Im gonna go through the ds160 once

[6/10/22, 7:59:32 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: So like fir we need to get a new passport
But if you already got a new one, it should be fine right?
[6/10/22, 7:59:46 PM] Ankit Gupta: give address of the grad school
[6/10/22, 7:59:51 PM] Ankit Gupta: YMGrad said so
[6/10/22, 7:59:55 PM] Haya Columbia: Which is....
[6/10/22, 7:59:58 PM] Haya Columbia: ....this
[6/10/22, 8:00:04 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Give it exactly like it's given in i20
[6/10/22, 8:00:06 PM] Ankit Gupta: yea
[6/10/22, 8:00:13 PM] Haya Columbia: For place of stay
[6/10/22, 8:00:18 PM] Haya Columbia: Not school address
[6/10/22, 8:00:31 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Na collegepond said so
[6/10/22, 8:00:36 PM] Haya Columbia: Hm.
[6/10/22, 8:00:43 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: I gave ISSO adress
[6/10/22, 8:00:57 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Both work
[6/10/22, 8:01:06 PM] Haya Columbia: Thats what i think
[6/10/22, 8:02:37 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: That's what I thought, but no. Expired passports are also sensitive documents and can be misused. The police need not find the passport, but the FIR is needed if the consulate asks for your old passports and you don't have it. I'm not sure of this, but better safe than sorry. 
A few notes - 
1. Consulate asks sometimes for old passports
2. Consulate also knows if you have expired passports, so you can't lie saying this is the only passport
[6/10/22, 8:03:20 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Do they need seperate FIRs, I mentioned all in one
[6/10/22, 8:03:55 PM] Haya Columbia: Thats what i was saying, yeah
[6/10/22, 8:04:09 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: Correct
[6/10/22, 8:04:16 PM] Haya Columbia: You report it as lost so that if someone misuses it in the future, you wont get in trouble
[6/10/22, 8:04:20 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Ohhokayy 
Yes actually makes sense, passports are sensitive documents, in case they might be misused.
[6/10/22, 8:04:29 PM] ‪+91 83088 20599‬: But you need lost passport Report
[6/10/22, 8:04:30 PM] Haya Columbia: You need a separate Lost Document Report for each passport
[6/10/22, 8:04:32 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: Not sure about that, better to call consulate helpline. They are responsive. I called them.
[6/10/22, 8:04:52 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: I think we should make an FAQ section
[6/10/22, 8:05:01 PM] Haya Columbia: Check specifically for a paid form on police website called the LDR
[6/10/22, 8:05:07 PM] Haya Columbia: I tried to make one ages ago 😂
[6/10/22, 8:05:38 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: Send it, I'll clean it up and put it here
[6/10/22, 8:06:05 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: 🙌🏽
[6/10/22, 8:06:16 PM] ‪+91 97057 92999‬: Ok then will it work if I file an FIR now and submit it during the Visa interview?
[6/10/22, 8:06:39 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: +1. FAQs are indeed very frequent
[6/10/22, 8:07:47 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: I found mine though. Should I still report?

Lol neither the police officer nor passport office guys told me to do all this XD
[6/10/22, 8:10:32 PM] Haya Columbia: For social media, specifically fb and linkedin, did you put the entire url
[6/10/22, 8:10:37 PM] Haya Columbia: Or just your name name
[6/10/22, 8:10:40 PM] Haya Columbia: *full name

[6/11/22, 10:53:03 AM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: Everyone, happy to see majority of folks getting slots, but to those who are still looking for one, or haven't due to various reasons, I anticipate another round of openings soon ( cue : how it usually happens & they said on visa day ) 
This is what you can go through and attempt to get one.
1. It's sad to see the state and time consumed ,but pls remember you can't do anything.
You need the slot , you need to get it.

2. How did some people try and get ? 
There is no foolproof method or strategy or anything just the same steps everyone knows.
Simple :
a) Just login via Incognito Chrome preferably since tried and worked for bunch of people.
Keep focus on page and refresh(f5 key) and press on continue or (enter key) if there is a pop up.
b)If there is no pop up then just do refresh (f5) this happens when u reach the last step i e after error at consular vac dates.
c) Ignore the date or time whatever is shown on screen or any label saying sorry you cannot book the date or reschedule appointment etc , just select the earliest time or the time that shows more no of slots among the options. Do not try to change the dates not gonna help in any way only will delay to reach till the last step.
What's more imp is you get a slot , don't try to be picky atm.
d) Continue doing the loop AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WILL ENCOUNTER.

It looks like it is a shadow or intermediate screen you get ( sorry the site is down please try later) not sure exactly.
But yes the loop is after login:
Ofc captcha screen with tick sometimes image -> shadow screen ( many times) -> select ofc date screen -> shadow screen (many times) -> vis appt screen captcha with tick sometimes image -> shadow screen ( many times) -> vis slots page.
That's one loop. you might have to go through such loops 'n' no of times where nobody knows how much 'n' is.

Some used Us vpns or use diff browser like mozilla etc, you can try that if it works then good for you.

Disclaimer : Pls don't quote anyone or anything, please try and do what helps you, this is what worked for few hence shared.
[6/11/22, 10:55:49 AM] ‪+91 72328 92643‬: Guys, are you taking the booster dose in India or will take it in the US?
[6/11/22, 10:56:06 AM] ‪+91 93405 97518‬: I took mine here
[6/11/22, 10:57:20 AM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: Better to take here than in the US. Any one between Covaxin or Covishield
[6/11/22, 10:57:47 AM] ‪+91 72328 92643‬: Yeah
[6/11/22, 10:59:03 AM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Take Covishield
[6/11/22, 11:00:23 AM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: I don't think they accept Covaxin because the Patient portal also asks you which vaccine did you take and Covaxin wasn't one of the options
[6/11/22, 11:01:32 AM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: I have taken Covishield booster, but I thought both are WHO approved🤔
[6/11/22, 11:01:50 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: They accept both
[6/11/22, 11:02:03 AM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: Yes that's what I thought
[6/11/22, 11:02:16 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: I have their confirmation on email
[6/11/22, 11:02:56 AM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: Do you mean Columbia health portal ? I saw both options ( Covaxin & Covidshield there)
‎[6/11/22, 11:04:33 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: ‎image omitted
[6/11/22, 11:04:36 AM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Covaxin is there on the list
[6/11/22, 11:05:35 AM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Ohh great
[6/11/22, 11:05:55 AM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Then it's fine
[6/11/22, 11:07:10 AM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Must have missed it
[6/11/22, 11:08:45 AM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: Is it?
One just has to reach before orientation right
[6/11/22, 11:12:29 AM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: PDL starts earlier
[6/11/22, 11:13:11 AM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: I guess that's the reason, but I remember in a couple of Webinars they said mid-august
[6/11/22, 11:13:35 AM] ‪+91 82801 33261‬: Would these be in-person?
[6/11/22, 11:13:42 AM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Yes
[6/11/22, 11:14:07 AM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: Are you sure?
[6/11/22, 11:14:49 AM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Yeah, they should have a schedule up soon
[6/11/22, 11:36:32 AM] ‪+91 72328 92643‬: Wasn't 26 August the official start date? I remember Columbia staff mentioning about arrival date to be in mid-August so that we can settle down and get accustomed with other things.
[6/11/22, 11:37:08 AM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah same
[6/11/22, 11:39:35 AM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Well from 26 aug the orientation starts
[6/11/22, 11:39:53 AM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Don't know about this
[6/11/22, 11:42:07 AM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: We'll get Gabby to confirm in the next session. I think that's what I heard in the April 8 webinar. Could be misremembering though.
[6/11/22, 12:19:39 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: iirc she mentioned in-person sessions will happen ,once we start at Columbia officially i.e post orientation is what I think, let's not speculate further ,rather simply ask in upcoming session.
[6/11/22, 12:28:59 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: The PDL sessions in the beginning will be online
Even through the semester, most of them will be hybrid
[6/11/22, 12:41:37 PM] ‪+91 95295 36395‬: Are you guys able to do course registration?
[6/11/22, 12:41:55 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s  8th August
[6/11/22, 12:42:05 PM] ‪+91 96431 20943‬: It’s from 8th August right? Course registration?
[6/11/22, 12:42:13 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeppp
[6/11/22, 12:44:06 PM] ‪+91 95295 36395‬: Ohh okay, I was looking at ssol.columbia.edu. and they asked to complete immunization before course registration. 

Also, it's open to current students that's why I thought I'm not able to register as my immunization is not complete.
[6/11/22, 12:44:46 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah it’s open for current students, but it begins for us on 8th afaik
[6/11/22, 12:45:04 PM] ‪+91 95295 36395‬: Okay cool! Thanks

[6/11/22, 3:12:07 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: I booked my slot by about 10:30
[6/11/22, 3:12:56 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Were you able to get a slot ?
[6/11/22, 3:14:28 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: No i havent tried yet
[6/11/22, 3:14:46 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: I am planning to join different university but the i20 is delayed
[6/11/22, 3:15:09 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: So wanted to check if i can book using Columbia i20 and change that later
[6/11/22, 3:15:20 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: Is anyone here doing something similar?
[6/11/22, 3:15:28 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Don't wait for the I20 just book a slot with Columbia's i20
[6/11/22, 3:15:38 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: I am doing the same
[6/11/22, 3:15:39 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Yes
[6/11/22, 3:15:51 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: But my final choice is Columbia
[6/11/22, 3:15:55 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: I did the same with NeU's i20
[6/11/22, 3:15:56 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: I don't have Columbia's I20
[6/11/22, 3:16:19 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: Oh i see thanks
[6/11/22, 3:16:25 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: Do you know if it's safe?
[6/11/22, 3:16:31 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Yeah just get a slot ASAP
[6/11/22, 3:16:35 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: No complications during vi?
[6/11/22, 3:16:47 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Change your I20 number later
[6/11/22, 3:16:53 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Yes, there is nothing wrong in that
[6/11/22, 3:16:59 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Yeah when you get the new i20 just update your DS 160 and transfer your sevis by going back to the Fmjee website
[6/11/22, 3:17:04 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: Without paying the sevis fee right?
[6/11/22, 3:17:09 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Yes
[6/11/22, 3:17:27 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: And during your biometric, tell them to update with and show them your new ds 160
[6/11/22, 3:17:33 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: You'll have to notify the university that you already have a SEVIS number
[6/11/22, 3:17:45 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: So that by the time you go for your interview, your colleg is updated
[6/11/22, 3:17:56 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: They transfer your I20 to the new uni
[6/11/22, 3:17:57 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Don't have to do that
[6/11/22, 3:18:14 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: Don't submit the ds-160 right?
[6/11/22, 3:18:23 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: When are you guys getting slots for?
[6/11/22, 3:18:29 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Just go to the Fmjee website there is a request transfer option
[6/11/22, 3:18:37 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: Just keep the application number and then use it to book vi slots?
[6/11/22, 3:18:46 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Just select that it'll ask you for the new sevis id in your i20 from the new University
[6/11/22, 3:19:03 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Yeah application number is the most important
[6/11/22, 3:19:12 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: That's the only thing that won't change
[6/11/22, 3:19:27 PM] ‪+91 98849 64696‬: If we don't submit it...we can just change i20 right?
[6/11/22, 3:19:52 PM] ‪+91 88377 30193‬: Requesting the University to transfer your i20 is only when you are already there and transferring to a different schools mid college season

[6/12/22, 12:04:35 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: From what I remember
[6/12/22, 12:05:02 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: $623
[6/12/22, 12:05:09 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: The price is written on their website
[6/12/22, 12:05:09 PM] Ankit Gupta: Thanks
[6/12/22, 12:05:36 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Oh that’s just the service fee I see
[6/12/22, 12:06:13 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: Per semester?
[6/12/22, 12:06:24 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah
[6/12/22, 12:06:28 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Refer this
[6/12/22, 12:06:37 PM] Haya Columbia: Nah it was like 4 grand
[6/12/22, 12:06:40 PM] Haya Columbia: Yeh
[6/12/22, 12:07:08 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah yeah the health insurance cost + service fee according to this is $5138
[6/12/22, 12:07:18 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: For the entire year
[6/12/22, 12:07:34 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: Is this included in the I20 cost?
[6/12/22, 12:09:12 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes
[6/12/22, 12:09:31 PM] ‪+91 96826 67343‬: the I20 cost is around $90600 so i guess yes! that excludes personal expenses
[6/12/22, 12:09:51 PM] Haya Columbia: I asked before. It does
[6/12/22, 12:26:55 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Isn’t the estimated room and board cost a bit crazy!
[6/12/22, 12:27:58 PM] Ankit Gupta: Judging by most of Ivy students being from rich families, this is appropriate
They just took median housing costs
[6/12/22, 12:28:10 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Hmm makes sense
[6/12/22, 12:28:20 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: I don't understand why monthly metrocard is $1143 whereas it's actually only 4x$127
[6/12/22, 12:29:00 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s 9 months
[6/12/22, 12:29:06 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: 4 in fall 5 in spring
[6/12/22, 12:29:12 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: 9*127
[6/12/22, 12:29:33 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: $1143
[6/12/22, 12:31:07 PM] ‪+91 79809 16814‬: Is it compulsory to take this metro card or are they just showing the expenses which a student can incur for a the two semesters?
[6/12/22, 12:31:23 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Not compulsory
[6/12/22, 12:31:36 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: But it’s always advised to take the MetroCard if you’re gonna travel a lot
[6/12/22, 12:31:43 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: That’s the cheapest form of travel
[6/12/22, 12:32:02 PM] Ankit Gupta: technically it's walking xD
[6/12/22, 12:32:09 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: 😂😂
[6/12/22, 12:32:29 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: Oh cool
[6/12/22, 12:32:31 PM] ‪+91 99166 13318‬: The monthly cost is $127 for the metro card ?
[6/12/22, 12:32:42 PM] ‪+91 79809 16814‬: Why will we travel if we are looking for houses near campus 🫣 might be 2-3 times a month
[6/12/22, 12:32:48 PM] ‪+91 87581 97321‬: Yes
[6/12/22, 12:33:05 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah so you can take that out
[6/12/22, 12:33:08 PM] ‪+91 79809 16814‬: Can go for per ride fare of 2.75 right 🤔
[6/12/22, 12:33:16 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp
[6/12/22, 12:34:28 PM] ‪+91 99166 13318‬: Maybe they have like a yearly pass too that's significantly cheaper
[6/12/22, 12:34:37 PM] ‪+91 79809 16814‬: Cool 👍🏻
[6/12/22, 12:39:04 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Also, the OMNY card is preferable to the MetroCard since it has a fare calling feature
[6/12/22, 12:39:10 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: *fare capping
[6/12/22, 12:47:05 PM] Haya Columbia: Monthly Metrocard is useful ONLY if you travel everyday of the month
[6/12/22, 12:50:07 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Yeah, the metro card isn’t worth it, from personal experience
[6/12/22, 12:50:21 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Unless you’re commuting via subway daily
[6/12/22, 12:51:41 PM] Haya Columbia: Like say you live in Jersey or long island or something. Then metrocard is worth it
[6/12/22, 12:59:53 PM] Rohit Columbia: What's that?
[6/12/22, 1:00:15 PM] Rohit Columbia: Is it charged per ride?
[6/12/22, 1:03:53 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: The weekly $33 dollar charge comes out to about 12 rides at the price of the Norma 2.75 per ride. Once you exceed 12 rides, the fare gets capped and all your subsequent rides in the week are free
[6/12/22, 1:04:01 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: *normal
[6/12/22, 1:05:39 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: You don’t need a specific card for OMNY
If you pay for the metro with any contactless methods like tapping your credit/debit card, it does the job
[6/12/22, 1:06:41 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Although it’s not very enough that you’ll be using the subway more than 12 times a week, again unless you’re daily commuting
[6/12/22, 1:06:46 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: very often*
[6/12/22, 1:38:50 PM] ‪+91 98111 94792‬: Yeah and I think the monthly pass is for 127$
[6/12/22, 1:41:03 PM] ‪+91 98111 94792‬: Oh lol realized it's already mentioned above
[6/12/22, 1:41:43 PM] ‪+91 81481 66043‬: Has anybody here taken an unsecured loan from an Indian bank?

[6/13/22, 12:24:46 PM] Ankit Gupta: +1
[6/13/22, 12:39:21 PM] ‪+91 94265 43421‬: Had my VI at Mumbai today.

[6/13/22, 12:45:10 PM] ‪+91 98111 94792‬: Thanks Dhairya!
[6/13/22, 12:49:17 PM] Ankit Gupta: Does it matter to them if you tell them about non-US applications?
[6/13/22, 12:52:25 PM] ‪+91 98193 22020‬: Thanks!
[6/13/22, 12:53:20 PM] Haya Columbia: Apparantly not
[6/13/22, 12:53:29 PM] Haya Columbia: You can if you want to
[6/13/22, 12:53:38 PM] Haya Columbia: But they typically only care about us schools
[6/13/22, 12:54:15 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Sorry if already answered, should we carry photographs to biometrics/interview ?
If yes then what is the recommended size?
[6/13/22, 12:55:48 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Do we have a passport book number ?
[6/13/22, 12:56:16 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: N.A. for us I guess..
[6/13/22, 12:57:30 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: NA
[6/13/22, 12:59:48 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: You can just go and tell a good photography studio that you need a US visa specification passport size photograph and they know what all things are needed generally
[6/13/22, 1:01:09 PM] Rohit Columbia: Not needed for regular biometric/interview 
However, it is required for dropbox appointments as per specs provided in website
[6/13/22, 1:03:13 PM] ‪+91 96620 62572‬: Has anyone’s Dropbox being put on hold for form 221(g)?
[6/13/22, 1:03:27 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: I got 221 g
[6/13/22, 1:12:13 PM] ‪+91 77220 77175‬: Hey guys. I will be pursuing MS in data science , however Columbia issued me the I20 stating Major 1 as Computer Science. So what should I fill in the DS 160 Course of study ?
[6/13/22, 1:12:41 PM] ‪+91 90820 50695‬: Fill as per I-20
[6/13/22, 1:12:58 PM] ‪+91 90820 50695‬: I am also in DS and did the same
[6/13/22, 1:45:07 PM] ‪+91 99997 69125‬: Will that not be a problem since the admission letter mentions data science?
[6/13/22, 1:45:38 PM] Ankit Gupta: ‎This message was deleted.
[6/13/22, 1:47:06 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: It shouldn’t really matter 
Plenty of people fill it according to the name of the degree, and don’t have any issues
[6/13/22, 1:47:26 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Either works
[6/13/22, 1:49:55 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: yes either might work ,as u have course details in admit letter however safer is to fill as per i20 as thats the document VO/VI will see, i gave all details as per i20 which has worked so yes.
[6/13/22, 1:53:30 PM] ‪+91 99997 69125‬: Fair enough. In that case, how would you answer the "what are you going to study" question during the interview?
[6/13/22, 1:54:46 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: i ll be pursuing the course Masters in Data science at Columbia which has a cip code of Computer Science 11.0701 as listed on i20
[6/13/22, 1:54:54 PM] ‪+91 90820 50695‬: ISSO recommended to write as per I-20
[6/13/22, 1:55:44 PM] ‪+91 99877 52240‬: Photograph is 2 inchx2 inch for visa
[6/13/22, 1:56:17 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: yes not reqd for people who are gonna give biometric + interview, but reqd for dropbox it seems
[6/13/22, 2:25:07 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Cool, thanks guys 😊
[6/13/22, 2:50:46 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Did anyone submit visa fee in the bank?

[6/13/22, 7:23:05 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Hi, do we need to carry any receipt indicating payment application fees i.e. 180$ while going to visa interview ?
[6/13/22, 7:29:53 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Nope
[6/13/22, 7:29:57 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Appointment confirmation is enough
[6/13/22, 7:30:13 PM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Ok
[6/13/22, 7:36:20 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Just to confirm, we have to pay only 2 types of fee's right, one is 185$ for booking visa slot and the other is SEVIS fee (350$). There is no free involved with DS160 right?
[6/13/22, 7:36:39 PM] ‪+91 90110 59305‬: Correct
[6/13/22, 7:37:00 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Cool🤘
[6/13/22, 8:07:31 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Is the visa fee variable ?
[6/13/22, 8:10:12 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Naa
[6/13/22, 8:10:31 PM] ‪+91 81794 77224‬: What should we keep for US point of contact info ?

[6/13/22, 8:11:41 PM] ‪+91 81794 77224‬: Okk thanks
[6/13/22, 8:13:23 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: sometimes if the exchange rate changes a bit over weeks or month but not much diff always  ~12k INR
[6/13/22, 8:13:52 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Its 160$ tho, right
[6/13/22, 8:14:41 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: yes for all
[6/13/22, 8:23:46 PM] ‪+91 94265 43421‬: it's better if you take it with you.
[6/13/22, 8:25:24 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: VISA fee -160 USD!
[6/13/22, 8:25:34 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s fine, the appointment confirmation is indirectly a confirmation of payment
[6/13/22, 8:30:46 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Hey, little off topic, but after one of our PDL sessions on history of columbia, I read more about it, and found a whole lot of wholesomeness in the initial advertisement/design for Columbia University.

"Deriving its reference from the explorer Christopher Columbus" - is this true? 
I thought Columbus was scorned upon in the US. 
Coz he represented colonization.
[6/13/22, 10:22:37 PM] Ankit Gupta: Southern Americans observe Columbus Day to this day
[6/13/22, 10:23:07 PM] Rohit Columbia: Oh I see
[6/13/22, 10:23:54 PM] ‪+91 99101 37571‬: Hello guys,
need some inputs regarding the immunisation formalities.
So most of us might not have the seasonal flu shot done already. Can we skip that one or it’s advisable to get that done here itself.
[6/13/22, 10:24:10 PM] Haya Columbia: better to get it there
[6/13/22, 10:24:30 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Yes 
So many places have names after him
So like he discovered it and a number of places which came to be known after him to the world. So, sort he sort of represent this initial America before colonisation ( that's what I understood from the online search )
[6/13/22, 10:24:32 PM] Rohit Columbia: It can be taken in the university 
We should get a mail in july/ august
[6/13/22, 10:24:36 PM] Haya Columbia: always get the flu shot in the place you're going to (or if you're getting it here, atleast get one meant for people travelling there)
[6/13/22, 10:34:05 PM] ‪+91 99101 37571‬: Makes sense, thanks for your inputs :)

[6/14/22, 8:30:56 AM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: You still need proof for MR for 2nd dose

Is that a problem?
[6/14/22, 8:51:49 AM] Haya Columbia: Yes. They rejected my first dose  for being 15 days before my first bday
[6/14/22, 9:01:49 AM] ‪+91 98999 54591‬: Yeah same for me
[6/14/22, 9:02:13 AM] Haya Columbia: Problem is the difference in state laws
[6/14/22, 9:02:23 AM] Haya Columbia: I had my baby vaccinations all in Texas
[6/14/22, 9:02:39 AM] Haya Columbia: Where I am considered fully compliant with all state mandated vax laws

[6/14/22, 9:02:50 AM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: Make sure Your measles vaccination date should be after your 1 year of your birth else they won’t consider it

[6/14/22, 10:48:59 AM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: We can work on F1 visa? 
Like we graduate then
We can work for 3 years right, without filing for H1B1?
[6/14/22, 10:55:10 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Yeah, on an OPT
[6/14/22, 10:56:31 AM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: So, up to three years this works right?
And ideally a good employer - 
Will file an H1B1 for us for the start of first year only right?
[6/14/22, 10:56:54 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Yeah (3 years for STEM degrees)
[6/14/22, 10:56:59 AM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Because we would get three chances to be picked up in the lottery for H1B1 this way?
[6/14/22, 10:57:06 AM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: There are multiple lotteries in a year
[6/14/22, 10:57:11 AM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Ohh
[6/14/22, 10:57:29 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: You should look for an employer willing to sponsor an H1 if you want to continue in the States
[6/14/22, 10:58:23 AM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Okayy
So I ask them right? There might be chance that I want to continue for more than 3 years, would you please work on my H1 also?
[6/14/22, 10:58:24 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: A lot of them do, but just keep it in mind when looking for jobs

[6/14/22, 10:59:26 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Yeah, starting from year 1 itself
[6/14/22, 10:59:41 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: You get multiple chances to apply for the H1 visa that way
[6/14/22, 10:59:54 AM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Okayy

[6/14/22, 12:18:00 PM] ‪+91 99823 93487‬: Can we change location also at the time of emergency request
[6/14/22, 12:27:34 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Not sure of that
[6/14/22, 12:27:38 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Nope
[6/14/22, 12:31:25 PM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: Location can be changed only for OFC (Biometrics), for Interview location would be the same as for the placeholder slot that was booked.
[6/14/22, 12:38:09 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: They're opening slots regularly during the morning now so be on the lookout
[6/14/22, 12:52:46 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: If we exhaust all our rescheduling attempts, then can we make an emergency appointment?
[6/14/22, 12:55:11 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: You can book an emergency appointment only If you are in the 30 day period before your course start date.
[6/14/22, 12:59:13 PM] Haya Columbia: I dont believe the two are related
[6/14/22, 12:59:30 PM] Haya Columbia: Because you apply and are given an emergency slot, right?
[6/14/22, 12:59:33 PM] Haya Columbia: Not book it
[6/14/22, 12:59:52 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Yeah, just wanted to confirm though
[6/14/22, 1:00:13 PM] ‪+91 77382 04999‬: Nope. You need to book it. They make the earlier slots available to you
[6/14/22, 1:00:28 PM] Haya Columbia: Ah
[6/14/22, 1:00:36 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Yes you need an appointment in the first place to reschedule it to an emergency but emergency should be only used in that 30 day period
[6/14/22, 1:00:44 PM] Haya Columbia: Sorry, I'm not sure
[6/14/22, 1:00:48 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Otherwise they cancel it
[6/14/22, 1:00:52 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: I think its 60
[6/14/22, 1:01:25 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Atleast that is the mentioned period on the site
[6/14/22, 1:01:37 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp
[6/14/22, 1:02:01 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Yeah sorry 60
[6/14/22, 1:02:15 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: But only use it as a last resort
[6/14/22, 1:03:16 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Why, is there any issue with this ?
[6/14/22, 1:04:16 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Last year a friend of mine had booked an emergency appointment and it got cancelled. He had to then go thru an agent to get his visa. It got pretty messed up
[6/14/22, 1:05:23 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: 😬
[6/14/22, 1:09:37 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Sounds like one of those campfire stories

[6/14/22, 8:15:50 PM] ‪+91 95306 66033‬: Hi guys, as the PDL class is talking about credit cards and credit history. So anybody here thought about taking ZOLVE cards or any thoughts about it.
[6/14/22, 8:16:26 PM] Haya Columbia: be careful with cards like zolve and capital one though, very easy to get caught in credit traps
[6/14/22, 8:18:49 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: Zolve seems to be a neobank, I would recommend sticking with established institutions as your main account. Sort of like how it's not wise to install iOS beta on your main phone.
[6/14/22, 8:19:03 PM] ‪+91 95306 66033‬: Yeah.
[6/14/22, 8:19:07 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Ya, I was thinking of taking it. But since I have applied for it, I have been receiving calls from private numbers saying they are from zolve (these PPL can't even pronounce zolve😅), so I have my suspicions on them.
[6/14/22, 8:19:52 PM] Haya Columbia: exactly
[6/14/22, 8:20:09 PM] Haya Columbia: Never sign up for a credit card over phone
[6/14/22, 8:20:19 PM] Haya Columbia: its criminal how easy it is to get a credit card in the us
[6/14/22, 8:20:35 PM] Haya Columbia: unlike here, anybody there can be a credit card company
[6/14/22, 8:20:45 PM] Haya Columbia: and telemarketing for credit cards is huge
[6/14/22, 8:21:02 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Oh is it😥
[6/14/22, 8:21:12 PM] Haya Columbia: telemarketing is huge in general, very highlytrained salespeople who wont let you say no
[6/14/22, 8:21:20 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: There’s a few people here that use Zolve and it IS pretty convenient ngl
But having said that, you’re probably better off just coming here and getting a BOA credit card
[6/14/22, 8:21:30 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Until you have an SSN, then you can get better ones
[6/14/22, 8:22:02 PM] Haya Columbia: like say you had $30m, you can just register with FDIC, make a deal with like mastercard for example
[6/14/22, 8:22:17 PM] Haya Columbia: and you can start issuing "Rohan Sheelvant Credit cards"
[6/14/22, 8:22:35 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: 😂😂
[6/14/22, 8:23:37 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Hmm 😂
[6/14/22, 8:50:25 PM] ‪+91 99345 21831‬: Guys, are you planning to take the insurance provided by columbia or you're looking for something else
[6/14/22, 8:54:58 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: International students have to take Columbia Health cover 
https://www.health.columbia.edu/content/international-students
[6/14/22, 8:57:03 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Scroll down, there are certain exceptions to this
[6/14/22, 8:57:43 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: The Columbia plan is pretty convenient though, so should be good enough
[6/14/22, 8:57:44 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: There’s no choice as such, unless you’re employed by a US company.
[6/14/22, 8:58:33 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: That’s one example of an exception
[6/14/22, 8:59:49 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: Unless you already have insurance in the USA, you don’t have a choice.. hence my answer to this question of shopping for other insurance
[6/14/22, 9:00:59 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Yeah that's sorta true. Otherwise u gotta do window shopping as to which insurance is accepted by the university and that's a hassle.
[6/14/22, 9:01:26 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Some people who had family/relatives here, got themselves added to their plan
You do have choices, but it’s quite a hassle
[6/14/22, 9:04:28 PM] ‪+91 99201 44190‬: Again, my answer was regarding opting out of Columbia insurance  for people who don’t already have an alternative in place…
[6/14/22, 11:42:15 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Guys, why do people reschedule their appointments?
[6/14/22, 11:42:53 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Also if we are trying to reschedule, are there chances of existing one getting lost? Or it stays?
[6/14/22, 11:43:07 PM] Haya Columbia: cos they either get an earlier one or cant attend the one they booked?
[6/14/22, 11:43:23 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Ohh
[6/14/22, 11:43:41 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: And all this about Mumbai not being good for visa interview does not matter right ?
[6/14/22, 11:43:48 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: If I be prepared well enough
[6/14/22, 11:44:00 PM] Haya Columbia: mumbai is good for visa interview
[6/14/22, 11:44:01 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: They would aprove some slots right 🥲?
[6/14/22, 11:44:04 PM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: Yep. Does not matter
[6/14/22, 11:44:06 PM] Haya Columbia: its great for interview
[6/14/22, 11:44:12 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Ohhh
[6/14/22, 11:44:12 PM] Haya Columbia: its terrible for dropbox
[6/14/22, 11:44:20 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Okayy that makes sense
[6/14/22, 11:44:25 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Ohh okayy
[6/14/22, 11:44:28 PM] Haya Columbia: but yeah
Dont go too rehearsed tho
[6/14/22, 11:44:59 PM] Haya Columbia: A vo said in an interview that you should answer the questions as you would when talking to a friend or familiy member
[6/14/22, 11:45:31 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Okayy
[6/14/22, 11:49:36 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: Hey guys, does anybody know of a locker facility inside Mumbai consulate or nearby?
[6/14/22, 11:51:28 PM] ‪+91 90339 03702‬: They have facility to put your mobile phones but not for backpacks
[6/14/22, 11:51:57 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: Ah ok thanks 👍
[6/14/22, 11:52:31 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: For backpack you need to go all the way to the Dropbox facility and pay 500
[6/14/22, 11:52:44 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: So unless it’s absolutely necessary to carry a bag, it’s advisable not to take a bag
[6/14/22, 11:52:54 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: Ah ok cools, just the file thn
[6/14/22, 11:53:04 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp

[6/14/22, 11:53:50 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Paid by debit card, and nope
[6/14/22, 11:54:11 PM] Ankit Gupta: So it's just docs in a file and your mobile?
[6/14/22, 11:54:15 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: I paid by credit card, didn’t receive anything
[6/14/22, 11:54:25 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp
[6/14/22, 11:54:38 PM] ‪+91 77979 93656‬: I have no clue … but for those who have interview waiver they should carry a photocopy of form I797 it says in the website.

[6/14/22, 11:58:31 PM] Haya Columbia: since dropbox isnt really meant for students, just been opened this year due to volume, they've not bothered to update the message
[6/14/22, 11:58:36 PM] Haya Columbia: dont worry about i797
[6/14/22, 11:58:48 PM] Haya Columbia: they mean i20 if youre a student, which you are

In addtion, how many times can I reschedule my appointment?

I think you can reschedule twice
[6/15/22, 2:40:36 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: Reschedule thrice*

[6/15/22, 7:11:25 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You have to upload before course registration
[6/15/22, 7:11:32 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: That’s on 8th August mostly
[6/15/22, 7:11:52 PM] ‪+91 99426 56157‬: 30 days before course registration ig
[6/15/22, 7:12:22 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah as a safety so they have time to process the documents
[6/15/22, 7:18:24 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Is there any specification for Columbia ID photo?
[6/15/22, 7:20:16 PM] ‪+91 95295 36395‬: Normal passport-type photo works.

[6/15/22, 8:36:51 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s recommended that you do
[6/15/22, 8:37:01 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: If your docs aren’t processed by 8th August you can’t register for courses
[6/15/22, 8:38:22 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Ohh
[6/15/22, 8:38:29 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Okayy will quickly finish this bit than
[6/15/22, 8:38:42 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Also by when does columbia asks us to pay for the fees?
[6/15/22, 8:38:57 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It should mostly be after you’ve registered for courses
[6/15/22, 8:39:03 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Okayy
[6/15/22, 8:39:07 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Since the fee depends on how many credits you’ve registered
[6/15/22, 8:39:28 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Yes makes sense
[6/15/22, 8:39:33 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Thank you!!

[6/15/22, 9:11:49 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: That doesn’t constitute a hold on the account
[6/15/22, 9:12:06 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: What all docs have to be submitted by 8th july?
[6/15/22, 9:12:16 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Just immunisation?
[6/15/22, 9:12:23 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp
[6/15/22, 9:12:41 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: No Immunisation clearance means there’s a hold on your SSOL account
[6/15/22, 9:12:45 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: What about health insurance
[6/15/22, 9:12:58 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Once you obtain immunisation clearance that hold is removed and you can register
[6/15/22, 9:13:06 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: What about covid doses ?? If i dont get a booster dose by then?
[6/15/22, 9:13:31 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: That’s different. That’s automatically made compulsory for international students in the semester bill unless you submit a waiver
[6/15/22, 9:13:56 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: We already will pay for it?
[6/15/22, 9:14:02 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: As of now not getting a booster isn’t necessary but it soon could be. In that case you’ll have to apply for a waiver
[6/15/22, 9:14:09 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: No there’s extra money for it
[6/15/22, 9:14:20 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Ok

[6/15/22, 9:16:17 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You can take it earlier btw. Indian govt allows students to take the booster according to destination country

But no harm in carrying some doc just so to avoid any trouble

[6/16/22, 12:55:55 AM] Haya Columbia: Also, couple things i think forgot to mention:

1. You only need to provide either the vax records *or* antibody tests, not both

However, to avoid any confusions, I recommend the antibody test as a airtight confirmation if you dont have your records

2. If you don't have your mmr records, but you or your physician or gp or pediatrician can recall the dates, then you can just submit the cu mmr form in place of the vax card or proof. (Provided you fill it correctly and your doctor puts their seal and sign on it)
3. Flu shots are best taken in once you get there, not to say you cant take a flu shot here that's meant for US. It's just easier and more effective to take it there.
4. You can edit anything you upload here anytime by just emailing 

5. Yes, you can take your 2nd or third or nth MMR vax today, even after 20 years, its still valid.
[6/16/22, 12:56:41 AM] Ankit Gupta: Keeping up with Haya

[6/16/22, 12:58:27 AM] Haya Columbia: 6. Do fill in the optional counselling services form. I intend to make use of the free counselling services offered at columbia, should I ever need to. 

There's no shame in going to a counsellor when you feel overwhelmed or down. Its natural and talking can help.


And so, You never know when you may need such a session and its easier just to have the paperwork formalities out of the way in advance.
[6/16/22, 12:59:26 AM] Haya Columbia: Ew. Why you gotta bring up a reference to the kardashians 😂

But 
This group is so much helpful, with all these questions other people ask which has a whole lot of information! For eg the immunization deadline, I might have missed it not for you all good people :) and some one else's question! 
So, I read through all the messages everytime because I know something important would be there ( and if we can some how keep the discussion a little bit more focussed, it would help others )!

[6/16/22, 11:13:29 PM] Haya Columbia: Guys, I'd like to remind everyone. 

This is an *unofficial and informal* group chat. 

Any help given on here is done so by mutual kindness and respect. 


While there has been a lot of banter today, there's been a hell of a lot more information exchanged just today

You are still free to ask aby questions. Even in the last hour, many people asked questions and they were answered.
[6/16/22, 11:14:19 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah and we’ve like been tagging people and answering, so that cuts down the “effort” of scrolling through to see your question answered as well 😅
[6/16/22, 11:15:02 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: according to me, it's defeating the overall purpose though, sharing useful information in a sea of messages isn't actually gonna help a lot here ..let's have another group and do all these informal sessions there.. totally okay
[6/16/22, 11:16:12 PM] Haya Columbia: This is the other group man
[6/16/22, 11:16:20 PM] Haya Columbia: The one for information is the one with Gabrielle in it
[6/16/22, 11:16:28 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: the original intent of this group when it wasn't made was for official or important communications so i would request another group for all informal discussions be formed

[6/16/22, 11:19:05 PM] Haya Columbia: I'll check if i have it

[6/17/22, 1:17:04 PM] Rohit Columbia: Yep it is common to have 1 month broker fee to 20% of annual rate. It is also contingent upon the area.
 Considering it is a 4bhk it is average ( just over a month rate ig which is fine). 5.7k is not per person.

[6/18/22, 1:42:11 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: What's this
[6/18/22, 1:42:13 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Just a suggestion ik its a healthy discussion but some people are really shit scared already to step in the USA among daily news of a lot of crimes happening there so while having such convos if u dont want ppl to see them just delete it later on
[6/18/22, 1:45:44 PM] ‪+91 90040 41578‬: They'll respond eventually just drop them a message and email. 

They were quite actively communicating with me when I was enquiring about their loan product. I didn't go ahead with Prodigy but I'm sure they'll get back to you ASAP.
[6/18/22, 1:46:11 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: It's a difficult conversation to have, totally agreed. Even I am scared. However, honestly I would prefer to have such conversations and prepare myself/stay aware and know the steps I need to take for my safety instead of trying to ignore. These things are real yk
[6/18/22, 1:46:19 PM] Haya Columbia: Man fucking one step forward two steps back
[6/18/22, 1:47:47 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Yes agreed to the point that how to avoid such situations is ok but then saying that nothing can help it if its gonna hapen it will happen is no solution and just will increase fear among ppl
[6/18/22, 1:47:53 PM] Haya Columbia: Every step of my fucking life in the last 2 years has been a nightmare, slowlyy leading up to this, and finally this morning, when i recd my passport stamped, I felt a moment of relief. 

And now, awesome. Next fuckup!!!!!
[6/18/22, 1:48:02 PM] Haya Columbia: Hip fucking hooray
[6/18/22, 1:49:22 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Since people don't like to talk about this it is so so difficult to understand how to take care of yourself if you are in a similar situation.
[6/18/22, 1:49:32 PM] Rohit Columbia: Dw. They should be able to reinstate the loan since it was fully approved. Might be some issue at their end
Mail 'em and check what the exact issue is
[6/18/22, 1:50:28 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: I mean the best we could do is to avoid it as much as possible. That's pretty much it.
[6/18/22, 1:51:11 PM] Haya Columbia: Okay man. Thanks.
[6/18/22, 1:51:23 PM] Haya Columbia: Sorry for my outburst. Just hit my thresh

[6/18/22, 1:52:40 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Calm down. Calm down 😅
[6/18/22, 1:53:13 PM] Rohit Columbia: I didn't pay attention to the exact convo but if it's the crimes you're worried about. These happen everywhere. US folks coming to India will be on the lookout for these in India. 
You just need a group to go to new places not just nyc but anywhere new. 

Trust me we are all in the same shoes, don't sweat it. Its just something to know about. Supporting each other is essential. We have many international students living there so no need to panic
[6/18/22, 1:54:03 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: +1. Couldn't have said it better
[6/18/22, 1:54:05 PM] ‪+91 90040 41578‬: Ik it's a fucked situation but chances are, it's a stupid glitch and they'll fix it ASAP.
[6/18/22, 1:59:52 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: I was enquiring about the the loan initially
I think they have that support email using which we can write to them and they reply -  info@prodigyfinance.com
Some customer agent will get back
Also 
Maybe try posting of fb groups which have more people, if this happened earlier with someone else
Maybe an error on their part?
[6/18/22, 2:03:20 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Also, anyone here took a vaccine for MMR, both doses ( and duration between those doses how much did you kept)? Is there any specific varient we need to take of the vaccine? Or just going to our paediatrician and asking them for the vaccine would work?
[6/18/22, 2:06:02 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: I just took the second dose. Just go to your paediatrician, no specific variant is required. The gap I guess should be 1 year between 2 doses if I am not wrong.
[6/18/22, 2:07:25 PM] ‪+91 84894 45657‬: Minimum 28 days for columbia

He may not be chinese.

But tbh, unless you're a racist, you can tell the difference between a chinese person and a vietnamese person or a korean person


Just like a majority of us can tell the difference between someone from rajasthan and someone from kerala
[6/21/22, 2:29:18 PM] Haya Columbia: Majorit of people *DONT* get rejected guys
[6/21/22, 2:29:31 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: Exactly
[6/21/22, 2:29:43 PM] ‪+91 87675 94701‬: It totally depends on how you carry yourself, how confident you are and the story you're telling in that 1 minute. Nothing should seem fishy. Any visa officer won't reject for no reason. As long as you don't have any criminal history don't worry you will get through, even with the Chinese guy.
[6/21/22, 2:29:44 PM] Haya Columbia: And afaik, no one from columbia has been rejected (some dropbox ppl got 221g but hot through after interview)

[6/21/22, 2:31:14 PM] Haya Columbia: Yup. 

Basic rules:

1. Be 100% honest and confident in what you're saying.

2. ONLY answer the question youve been asked. Straight to the point. Dont volunteer a single fact

3. Make sure there are no mostakes in documentation

[6/21/22, 2:31:28 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes it does
[6/21/22, 2:31:55 PM] Haya Columbia: In fact, they vet ivy students less at the embassy cos they know ivy schools vet their students a lot before admitting and more so before i20

If you have time read a book

But one time i was so tired on a 3 hour flight, all i remember is sitting down in my seat and putting the seatbelt on.

Very good chance you'll get rejected or atleast poked and prodded in the interview

[6/23/22, 9:35:11 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: You need

I20
SEVIS fee payment receipt
Appointment confirmation

[6/23/22, 9:35:28 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: It's meant for PhD students.
[6/23/22, 9:36:04 PM] Ankit Gupta: Peace
[6/23/22, 9:37:08 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: For Biometrics, they usually only check appointment letter, DS160 confirmation page, passport
[6/23/22, 9:37:22 PM] Ankit Gupta: Nothing about transcripts or grades or anything na?
[6/23/22, 9:37:34 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Nope. Not for biometrics

[6/23/22, 11:40:57 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Anyone knows the typical fee for 3rd party guarantors like Insurent, Rhino and TheGuarantors?
[6/23/22, 11:41:56 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: usually 70% - 80% of the entire unit
[6/23/22, 11:42:12 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: it's worth it if you can split with your housemates
[6/23/22, 11:42:18 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: of the monthly rent paid once?
[6/23/22, 11:42:30 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: but if you're the only one who needs a guarantor and your housemates dont, its a waste of money imo
[6/23/22, 11:42:30 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Ya
[6/23/22, 11:42:44 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: yes. one time free
[6/23/22, 11:43:01 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: i was not willing to pay $4k so i left it
[6/23/22, 11:43:22 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Why wouldn't the housemates require one if the owner is asking for it?
[6/23/22, 11:43:35 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: because you can use a personal guarantor
[6/23/22, 11:43:47 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: i.e. if you have a relative living in the states you can use them as a guarantor
[6/23/22, 11:43:51 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I thought the entire unit will typically have only one guarantor and multiple guarantors are not allowed?
[6/23/22, 11:44:08 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Or did I hear wrong?
[6/23/22, 11:44:10 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: some places will allow multiple
[6/23/22, 11:44:19 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: depends on the property manager
[6/23/22, 11:44:21 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: 2-3x of rent (one time) for entire apartment  so comes to 80% of rent one time per person

[6/24/22, 5:13:50 AM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Not always
Columbia housing just refers to apartments managed by Columbia

Also, Columbia’s medical campus is near the top of Manhattan, so that might be why they’re also managing some apartments in the Bronx

[6/27/22, 10:56:38 AM] Haya Columbia: To help others not get rejected
[6/27/22, 10:57:15 AM] Haya Columbia: Many people who got rejected (on other GCs in in like a dropbox chat for example) mention if they get refused

[6/28/22, 6:33:43 AM] Haya Columbia: My passport has my signature as when i was 15. Its different to how i sign now.

[6/28/22, 11:09:38 AM] ‪+91 99166 13318‬: For those who've been working - what happens to our PF accounts ?
[6/28/22, 11:11:16 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: You can choose to withdraw the amount or keep it as it is..
[6/28/22, 11:11:23 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: You can withdraw the money
[6/28/22, 11:11:27 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Yeah
[6/28/22, 11:11:54 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: If you put it in a bank or something, then interest would still be taxable
[6/28/22, 11:11:56 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: Interest will keep coming
[6/28/22, 11:12:12 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: yes
[6/28/22, 11:12:22 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: If you hang on to the PF, then yeah
[6/28/22, 11:12:38 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: But are we eligible to withdraw? We don't fall into any of their eligibility requirements
[6/28/22, 11:12:58 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: if we are unemployed for more than 2 months, we can I belive
[6/28/22, 11:13:03 AM] ‪+91 89845 24285‬: *believe
[6/28/22, 11:13:23 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: It's when you are laid off I think
[6/28/22, 11:13:35 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Due to lockdown etc
[6/28/22, 11:13:44 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: No no, I checked with my payroll team
[6/28/22, 11:13:51 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I think there is a 30% tax on withdrawal if you have worked in the company for less than 3 years.
[6/28/22, 11:14:07 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: 5 years*
[6/28/22, 11:14:13 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: If you’re not joining a new job (in which case you port it), you can withdraw the money
[6/28/22, 11:14:47 AM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: Interest wouldn’t be taxable if the annual amount deposited in the PF account is less than 2.5 lakhs.
[6/28/22, 11:15:12 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: The laid off/salary not paid scenario is not considered a withdrawal but a PF advance. Differently termed and different forms to fill to get the cash
[6/28/22, 11:15:25 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Taxable means that it would add to your taxable income
[6/28/22, 11:15:50 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: If that comes to less than 2.5l, then you’re not taxed due to your tax bracket

[6/28/22, 11:21:38 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: PF interest is not taxable
[6/28/22, 11:22:03 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: But if you withdraw the money, interest on that would be taxable (eg if you put it in an FD)
[6/28/22, 11:22:25 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Only after working for 5 years?
[6/28/22, 11:22:38 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Idk all the details though, I plan to withdraw, so just checked for that
[6/28/22, 11:23:03 AM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: That is the rule for gratuity. Not sure if it’s the same for PF
[6/28/22, 11:23:16 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: I worked less than 5 years, so didn’t bother finding out 😅
[6/28/22, 11:23:55 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Taxable then
[6/28/22, 11:24:00 AM] ‪+91 99166 13318‬: Ok basically - we CAN withdraw if we want to
[6/28/22, 11:24:08 AM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Those who showed personal funds, do we need some letter for EPF from the company? I read it on some chat I guess
[6/28/22, 11:24:35 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I withdrew recently. So can confirm that you can withdraw after you have quit your job and the last pf deposit has been made by your company.
[6/28/22, 11:24:55 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Thanks
[6/28/22, 11:25:07 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Any cooldown period?
[6/28/22, 11:25:28 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: After you have left your job
[6/28/22, 11:25:30 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I worked for 5+  years. So didn’t pay any tax. But I did hear that if you worked for less than 5, TDS would be done before funds are released.
[6/28/22, 11:26:02 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Wtf
[6/28/22, 11:26:19 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Thats not what the payroll guy told me 🤦‍♂️
[6/28/22, 11:26:37 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Never trust them then
[6/28/22, 11:27:09 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I applied a while after I quit, so I am unsure if there is a cool down period.
[6/28/22, 11:27:51 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: The online process if fairly simple. You need to fill a form 15g (pdf available on a search online) and upload with bank check scan.
[6/28/22, 11:28:14 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Got it
[6/28/22, 11:28:46 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Since the process is straightforward, you can just file for it, if they reject they will give you a reason. That will answer your cool down concern
[6/28/22, 11:29:03 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Makes sense
[6/28/22, 11:29:28 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: If it’s taxable, then I might just hang on to it for now…
[6/28/22, 11:30:12 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: The long pole is your company depositing the pf for your final month of employment. You can perhaps talk to your company to speed up the process. After that you can just “mark exit” for the  of account and request withdrawal (both can be done online)
[6/28/22, 11:31:05 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Will you withdraw in the next financial year then?
[6/28/22, 11:31:36 AM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Appreciate it. Thanks
[6/28/22, 11:32:44 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: I’ll see, I can anyways not withdraw in the next couple of months or so because of some logistical issues
[6/28/22, 11:32:46 AM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Sometimes a 15g is insufficient and you will be rejected and requested to provide a form 10c. This doc requires employer signature and their pf account details. My wife who worked for less than 5 years was asked for this. I however wasn’t.
[6/28/22, 11:32:53 AM] ‪+91 99586 92123‬: Will think about it after that
[6/28/22, 11:34:18 AM] ‪+91 99166 13318‬: Thank you !
[6/28/22, 11:34:26 AM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: this is accurate i believe it's 3 years, so better to take it after a year to save tax, else withdraw now but bear the tax
[6/28/22, 11:34:45 AM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: for those who have worked atleast 2.x years as of now

[6/28/22, 11:37:54 AM] ‪+91 99166 13318‬: ‎This message was deleted.
[6/28/22, 11:38:09 AM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: so it depends on one right, if your pf amount per month was x% and that x% accumulated hasn't exceeded the limit , you are tax exempted.
[6/28/22, 11:39:12 AM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: Yeah. I confirmed this with my HR. He said the same.
[6/28/22, 11:39:27 AM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: bit if it does and you haven't worked for 3 full years and then withdrawing tax - 30% applicable .
If you let it rest to complete the 3 year period then you would be able to withdraw original amount + interest accumated without tax.
[6/28/22, 11:39:41 AM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: is it 5 years ? i last checked it was 3 years only
[6/28/22, 11:39:51 AM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: 5 years
[6/28/22, 11:39:57 AM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: He said
[6/28/22, 11:40:14 AM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: Otherwise 10% tds would be deducted
[6/28/22, 11:41:10 AM] ‪+91 98881 22833‬: If the account is inactive for 3 years, you won’t get any interest on the money kept in the epf account

[6/28/22, 12:37:12 PM] ‪+91 84529 18115‬: consider the timing to land in NY also, you would preferably want to land in NY in morning to afternoon to avoid late night first time foreign travel in city after 2-3 hours immigration.

[6/28/22, 12:41:51 PM] ‪+91 90042 63509‬: Yeah that’s a good idea, emirates is EXTREMELY flexible regarding this
[6/28/22, 1:04:36 PM] ‪+91 98863 20197‬: Are there any cons to not withdrawing the pf amount now? I was going to just let it be since I don't rly need that amount rn

So do we need a guarantor when we rent in nyc?
Is there any possibility of getting a house without a guarantor?
[6/28/22, 6:12:11 PM] ‪+91 99711 06609‬: Almost all apartments would require a guarantor.
[6/28/22, 6:12:41 PM] ‪+91 99711 06609‬: You will rarely get an apartment that doesn't require guarantor
[6/28/22, 6:13:33 PM] Disha Khanted Columbia: Is there any thing like smaller apartments which have less rent need no guarantors ?
[6/28/22, 6:18:55 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Use 3rd part guarantor services that charge a fee for it.
[6/28/22, 6:24:33 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes. Search on the website 1mg
[6/28/22, 6:25:15 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Apartments in NYC are already small
[6/28/22, 6:25:22 PM] ‪+91 99660 02688‬: Yes but taking an antibody test would be better in my opinion
[6/28/22, 6:26:24 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: She meant less bedrooms
[6/28/22, 6:29:36 PM] ‪+91 96434 61235‬: Except student housing like I-house there seems to be no alternatives.
[6/28/22, 6:37:40 PM] Ankit Gupta: So all inmates have to have a guarantor?
Or one suffices?
[6/28/22, 6:37:59 PM] Ankit Gupta: *roommates 🤦🏻‍♂️
[6/28/22, 6:38:23 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Guarantor is for the apartment as a whole
[6/28/22, 6:38:39 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: One should suffice but then your name wouldn’t be on the lease.
[6/28/22, 6:39:35 PM] Haya Columbia: @919987444995 you were right. He *was* in prison.

[6/28/22, 6:44:04 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Going in with everything
[6/28/22, 6:44:07 PM] Ankit Gupta: so the people having guarantors sign the lease?
[6/28/22, 6:44:11 PM] Haya Columbia: Its not the norm
But its possible yes
Depends on your agreement
[6/28/22, 6:44:17 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: The guarantors cumulative income should be 80X the per months rent.
[6/28/22, 6:44:19 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: I spoke to some brokers and found that this necessarily isn't true. You can have multiple guarantors.
[6/28/22, 6:44:26 PM] Haya Columbia: As a guarantor, they may have to.
[6/28/22, 6:44:33 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: You can talk with the broker. Most of them allow, depends
[6/28/22, 6:45:10 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: You will sign the lease, but if you default the payment, they will go after the guarantor.
[6/28/22, 6:45:40 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes
[6/28/22, 6:45:48 PM] ‪+91 90042 63509‬: My broker just suggested using a third part service because guarantors can’t be international, which is so in my case. Some third party companies will also pay your security deposit so that’s cute :)
[6/28/22, 6:45:50 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yep
[6/28/22, 6:45:53 PM] Haya Columbia: Btw guys.
[6/28/22, 6:45:57 PM] Haya Columbia: Important thing
[6/28/22, 6:46:10 PM] Haya Columbia: In the US, rent is a part of your credit score
[6/28/22, 6:46:11 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Most of them allow
[6/28/22, 6:46:18 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yepp
[6/28/22, 6:46:18 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: They charge 1-1.5X of Per months rent for this.
[6/28/22, 6:46:23 PM] Haya Columbia: So if you pay late or default, your score takes a hit.
[6/28/22, 6:46:26 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Yes
[6/28/22, 6:46:36 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Big one
[6/28/22, 6:46:45 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: They are pretty serious about it
[6/28/22, 6:47:00 PM] Haya Columbia: Guarantors can be international if they have a US presence (namely SSN)
[6/28/22, 6:47:09 PM] ‪+91 97171 77253‬: Does the credit we have generated here carry over?
[6/28/22, 6:47:13 PM] Haya Columbia: No
[6/28/22, 6:47:13 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: As well as guarantors!
[6/28/22, 6:47:27 PM] Ankit Gupta: can the uni become a guarantor?
We can pay them?
[6/28/22, 6:47:30 PM] Haya Columbia: Credit scores never cross borders. If any conoany promises you, they are lying
[6/28/22, 6:48:07 PM] Haya Columbia: But there are companies like Nova, that give you a high interest credit card there at high risk for them, based on your credit score here.
[6/28/22, 6:48:13 PM] Haya Columbia: I wouldnt recommend those though
[6/28/22, 6:48:37 PM] Haya Columbia: Afaik
Guarantors' credit score dont take a hit if you default
[6/28/22, 6:48:41 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: Yes you can, but that will only be able to get you a credit card. There’s a company called nova credit which does this.
[6/28/22, 6:48:44 PM] Haya Columbia: Only cosigners' does
[6/28/22, 6:48:57 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: Yes, it does.
[6/28/22, 6:49:10 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: Why wouldn’t you recommend, it seems pretty straightforward?
[6/28/22, 6:49:24 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: +1
[6/28/22, 6:49:24 PM] Haya Columbia: It wont "carry over"

They just give you a new credit card there based on your score here.

Then your credit starts there from the first month of that card
[6/28/22, 6:49:41 PM] Ankit Gupta: How does @918939007170 know so much information?
[6/28/22, 6:49:57 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Well he did his ug in London
[6/28/22, 6:49:58 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: So what’s the problem, it seems okay to me.

[6/28/22, 6:50:42 PM] Haya Columbia: As in, if you have a 780 credit score here with a history lasting 5 years, it wont carry there.  

You'll start a brand new one there from 600.
[6/28/22, 6:51:10 PM] Haya Columbia: I read lots of stuff.
[6/28/22, 6:51:26 PM] Haya Columbia: Lol noooo

[6/28/22, 6:51:53 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: Which is okay, No? Atleast you will be able to get an amex there directly. Which will in turn help you generate a good credit for the future.
[6/28/22, 6:52:06 PM] Haya Columbia: Travelling between 2 countries back and forth in direct flights dont count 

Hostel - airport - airport - home.
[6/28/22, 6:52:30 PM] Haya Columbia: Yeah i dont recommend cos of the terms that I read. Theyre not ideal, atleast for me
[6/28/22, 6:52:34 PM] Haya Columbia: ^^
[6/28/22, 6:53:14 PM] Haya Columbia: No. Uni wont do shit 

Try third party guarantors.
[6/28/22, 6:53:31 PM] Haya Columbia: At most the Uni will give you a letter confirming your status
[6/28/22, 6:53:42 PM] ‪+91 94066 66620‬: Ohh, Alright.
[6/28/22, 6:56:18 PM] ‪+91 95858 12000‬: No, the guarantors.com is significantly lesser

[6/28/22, 7:00:47 PM] ‪+91 81237 99849‬: Hey, any idea if it's okay for our parent to collect the visa if we are not at home ( for those who opted for premium delivery).

[6/28/22, 7:21:04 PM] Haya Columbia: Gov ID like aadhar.
[6/28/22, 7:22:00 PM] Haya Columbia: And makes sense to have a letter from you
[6/28/22, 7:22:07 PM] ‪+91 94395 90802‬: It is cool for your parents to receive it. They will need an identity proof
[6/28/22, 7:22:19 PM] Haya Columbia: But dont think its needed

I wanted to ask if there is a limit as to how much cash(in USD) can we carry while travelling to the US from India, on F1 visa? 
Also, the amount has to be endorsed/stamped/written on the passport or what?
[6/29/22, 5:03:55 PM] Haya Columbia: It's just legal stuff if you ever use the counselling services
[6/29/22, 5:04:31 PM] Haya Columbia: I believe USD 10,000 is the typical limit for non-declared cash
[6/29/22, 5:05:23 PM] ‪+91 99157 23590‬: It is advisable to carry no more than 8000 dollars
[6/29/22, 5:05:45 PM] Haya Columbia: If you plan to carry more than 10k cash (or if youre particualrky oldschool and carry travellers cheques), you have to go through the red channel at customs after you land
[6/29/22, 5:06:20 PM] ‪+91 88600 57584‬: Oh okay so upto 8k is fine?
[6/29/22, 5:06:24 PM] Haya Columbia: No need to have it stamped in passport afaik
[6/29/22, 5:06:35 PM] Haya Columbia: Upto 8k is fine but why would you carry that much cash
[6/29/22, 5:06:49 PM] ‪+91 99157 23590‬: Yes
[6/29/22, 5:06:53 PM] Haya Columbia: Use western union or somrthing and wire the money to the US
[6/29/22, 5:06:56 PM] ‪+91 96011 53415‬: Yeah, just have the receipt for it with you
[6/29/22, 5:07:02 PM] Haya Columbia: And you can collect it when youre there

[6/29/22, 5:07:26 PM] Haya Columbia: Oh yes. Use your passport and flight ticket when you go to get the cash and get a gst receipt for forex

[6/29/22, 5:08:57 PM] Haya Columbia: But do get a receipt with the date time and gst info
[6/29/22, 5:09:22 PM] Haya Columbia: Cos that much cash, you wont have issues but may be asked to prove its legit
[6/29/22, 5:13:31 PM] ‪+91 96011 53415‬: Moreover, this incident happened in past that dollars taken from the exchanges (not the banks but individually managed) was fake and the student was booked under criminal offences, when asked about the receipt he was not having one 🤷🏻‍♂️

[6/30/22, 12:02:27 PM] ‪+91 95295 36395‬: Maybe the offer letter which mentions your funding.
[6/30/22, 12:02:55 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes
[6/30/22, 12:03:33 PM] Haya Columbia: Basically if you've been talking to the uni or a prof about research and funding and that's what you're going to the US for

[6/30/22, 4:58:09 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Hey guys, I have a question- if we plan to travel to India during our winter/summer break, what is the procedure for it? Can we just travel without applying for anything on our F1 visa?
[6/30/22, 4:58:44 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Yup 
Pretty easy since your visa says multiple entries (M)
[6/30/22, 4:59:52 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: You must carry your valid and most recent I-20 everytime you leave the country and want to return. And the passport valid for 6 months beyond intended stay and valid visa
[6/30/22, 5:00:24 PM] ‪+91 70308 93931‬: Oh cool. Thanks!
[6/30/22, 5:17:49 PM] Haya Columbia: You just gotta tell the isso and get an updated i20 (which afaik, doesn't cost anything, if it does, wtf)
[6/30/22, 5:28:17 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Yes and you do need a valid signature from your dso on the 2nd page of your I-20. Make sure that you report your arrival within one week of entering the states to ISSO for SEVIS activation. ISSO might give an updated I-20 after that since the one we have rn is called the initial I-20 and the new one we will get after reaching there is called continuing I-20. Also keep all your I-20s safe.

[7/1/22, 8:56:48 PM] Haya Columbia: ^
[7/1/22, 9:03:19 PM] ‪+91 96011 53415‬: Wise cards are not available in India as of now, right?
[7/1/22, 9:03:49 PM] ‪+91 90110 59305‬: Any reviews on this?
[7/1/22, 9:09:17 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: no clue but i will get one is what ik coz they r the best
[7/1/22, 9:14:33 PM] Haya Columbia: No. Due to RBI regs, digital only banks are basically impossible in India, (even companies like Fi have tie ups with proper banks)

but you can open a US Wise acc.


US laws on the other hand, allow neobanks and stuff but you cannot have a physical card in hand unless you show proof of landing in the US
[7/1/22, 9:14:58 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: yea i will rather get a wise card in usa
[7/1/22, 9:15:08 PM] Haya Columbia: So you can open a wise or Zolve or Aeldra or whatever account, and get your card within a week of being in the US
[7/1/22, 9:15:18 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: i am currently having a forex card by icici its good
[7/1/22, 9:15:32 PM] Haya Columbia: Until then. They do typically give you access to every other aspect of your account. Just no physical card
[7/1/22, 9:15:38 PM] Haya Columbia: Or that.
[7/1/22, 9:16:04 PM] Haya Columbia: Ask the bank where your savings account is, for what type of forex cards they have. Might be useful in the short term.
[7/1/22, 9:16:34 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: use a forex card by icici or hdfc I went with icici bcoz of reasons I srsly don't rem but Ik for sure my dad looked into it and felt iciici was better after landing in USA take a wise card
[7/1/22, 9:16:37 PM] Haya Columbia: Also, just activate intl usage on your indian cards guys. There are more fees, yes but not bad for a week's usage.
[7/1/22, 9:17:05 PM] Haya Columbia: HDFC allows you to buy forex cards entirely through netbanking too. 

You need your ticket though afaik
[7/1/22, 9:17:24 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: i didnt even need a ticket
[7/1/22, 9:17:36 PM] Haya Columbia: Some banks ask. Some dont.
[7/1/22, 9:18:15 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: with icici they needed visa i think
[7/1/22, 9:19:11 PM] ‪+91 96011 53415‬: Yes that's correct, you won't get it in India. I also have opened zolve account, wherein you can get credit card without SSN once you land in US, and when you get a job and get SSN that credits will be transferred. I found it useful as US have everything linked to credit score 
https://zolve.page.link/8WGTHU33CHZhHXN37
[7/1/22, 9:20:34 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes. No bank or company will give you a physical card unless you show proof of arrival to the US (this is a law)
[7/1/22, 9:30:54 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: VISA compulsory.
Ticket, they are flexible about it.
[7/1/22, 9:30:58 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: I got an HDFC Forex card before moving here
I still use it to today, it’s really useful 

I personally didn’t use any credit cards while I didn’t have an SSN, but I’ve heard Zolve is good.
Once you guys get an SSN, get the Discover credit card, it’s a great starter card
[7/1/22, 9:33:46 PM] Disha Khanted Columbia: What’s your opinion on Niyo Bank card
[7/1/22, 9:34:54 PM] Sinjini Columbia: Are you still getting it?
[7/1/22, 9:34:57 PM] ‪+91 98331 60231‬: It's a good idea to check with your bank for forex cards.
Usually you get a good rate.
[7/1/22, 9:38:49 PM] ‪+91 96620 62572‬: I would recommend getting a US bank account and thier card ASAP when you land. It’ll be a huge help
[7/1/22, 9:41:57 PM] Haya Columbia: One or the other
[7/1/22, 9:42:07 PM] Haya Columbia: Some ask for visa some for ticket
[7/1/22, 9:42:18 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: What's the best way to deal with OTPs from online transactions based out of India?
[7/1/22, 9:42:31 PM] Haya Columbia: As in?
[7/1/22, 9:42:50 PM] Haya Columbia: Getting otp on indian numbers when outside?
[7/1/22, 9:42:59 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Yes
[7/1/22, 9:42:59 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: ive been using a relative all these years :(
[7/1/22, 9:43:00 PM] Haya Columbia: Or getting otp on a foreign number?
[7/1/22, 9:43:06 PM] Haya Columbia: International roaming!
[7/1/22, 9:43:11 PM] Haya Columbia: Or this
[7/1/22, 9:43:41 PM] Haya Columbia: I paid Rs. 300 per month (postpaid) for 4 years to airtel to keep my number on when i was in UK.
[7/1/22, 9:43:57 PM] Haya Columbia: Or you can convert to prepaid and pay the bare minimum which is like 100 per month
[7/1/22, 9:44:19 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Lycamobile is pretty good
I have been using it for 5 years! 
Also getting an international roaming pack for emergency when you go is helpful!
[7/1/22, 9:44:43 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: So you switched out your personal number with your relative's for your accounts?
[7/1/22, 9:45:19 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: That’s perfect
[7/1/22, 9:45:58 PM] Haya Columbia: Lyca's coverage is absolute shit
[7/1/22, 9:46:22 PM] Haya Columbia: They run on someone else's network no matter where in the world and hence get lowest priority.
[7/1/22, 9:46:26 PM] Haya Columbia: So shitty speed too
[7/1/22, 9:46:39 PM] Haya Columbia: Or just leave your sim here
[7/1/22, 9:47:47 PM] ‪+91 96826 67343‬: some banks do send OTP's to email linked with the bank account!
[7/1/22, 9:48:38 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: This is the case with HDFC.
[7/1/22, 9:48:51 PM] Haya Columbia: Ah okay
[7/1/22, 9:50:14 PM] Haya Columbia: You can also convert to an (or open a new) NRO account in which case you can use international phone numbers
[7/1/22, 9:50:34 PM] Ankit Gupta: the thread just confused me
What's the best forex?
What's the best credit card?
And the best telecom provider finally?
[7/1/22, 9:50:59 PM] Ankit Gupta: Zolve announced a credit card with a chance of 20k scholarship or something recently
[7/1/22, 9:51:00 PM] Haya Columbia: No such thing man. 

Do the research and pick one that best suits your needs.
[7/1/22, 9:51:04 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: I havent had issues but yes, they do rely on other network providers so its likely to happen
[7/1/22, 9:51:37 PM] Disha Khanted Columbia: I Already have one
[7/1/22, 9:55:44 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Whats the problem with that?
[7/1/22, 9:56:30 PM] Haya Columbia: No problem he was asking how
[7/1/22, 9:56:43 PM] Haya Columbia: I said international roaming, which is what i do
[7/1/22, 9:57:10 PM] ‪+91 97164 52083‬: You can open an NRO/NRI account only if you are earning or paying ITR in US.
[7/1/22, 9:57:16 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Yea
[7/1/22, 9:57:20 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Get a jio sim
[7/1/22, 9:57:26 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Thats the cheapest ig
[7/1/22, 9:58:37 PM] Haya Columbia: Vodafone and airtel are more reliable in intl roaming
[7/1/22, 9:58:41 PM] Haya Columbia: In that order
[7/1/22, 9:58:50 PM] Ankit Gupta: thank god
[7/1/22, 9:59:11 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Airtel is expensive 🥲
[7/1/22, 9:59:21 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Jio is fine didnt face any issue
[7/1/22, 9:59:27 PM] Haya Columbia: Its nearly the same no.
[7/1/22, 9:59:56 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: The country i wanted to go to they didnt have on their list and realised it was around 4k
[7/1/22, 10:00:00 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: With airtel
[7/1/22, 10:00:02 PM] Haya Columbia: I pay 1000 rs a month incl gst now for 2 connections on a mid range plan

Ill turn it down to the most basic plan.
[7/1/22, 10:00:08 PM] Haya Columbia: OH NO DONT USE THE PACKS
[7/1/22, 10:00:18 PM] Haya Columbia: Only use the packs if you intend to use the phone actively
[7/1/22, 10:00:31 PM] Haya Columbia: Otherwise it costs the same in US as in india just to keep the number on
[7/1/22, 10:00:37 PM] Haya Columbia: And incoming texts are free anyway
[7/1/22, 10:00:45 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Yea true
[7/1/22, 10:00:55 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: I pay 300 to keep the number active thats it
[7/1/22, 10:00:56 PM] Haya Columbia: Which is around 400 per month
[7/1/22, 10:01:06 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: I used intl roaming 1 st month here
[7/1/22, 10:01:12 PM] Haya Columbia: Yeah that but its 100rs more since last month 🥲
[7/1/22, 10:01:46 PM] Haya Columbia: Fun fact.

At&t prepaid with no contract is more expensive per month than airtel intl roaming packs 😂
[7/1/22, 10:01:59 PM] Haya Columbia: I intend to use airtel roaming for a week
[7/1/22, 10:02:32 PM] Haya Columbia: Great thing with airtel roaming is, you dont have to manually activate packs. 

They automatically select the cheapest one based on your usage, and bill you that in the next cycle
[7/1/22, 10:04:43 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: The only issue I faced with continuing my Indian phone number was that the uni or any landlines in the US couldnt call me on my Indian number. So its not the best to continue after a while…
[7/1/22, 10:06:42 PM] Haya Columbia: Dont use your indian number as a long term solution for US based work.
[7/1/22, 10:06:56 PM] Haya Columbia: But you can keep ot in for indian banks and aadhar and stuff
[7/1/22, 10:07:03 PM] Haya Columbia: Dont pay for packs
[7/1/22, 10:07:10 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: Agreed
[7/1/22, 10:12:35 PM] ‪+961 3 561 669‬: Can someone answer concisely and precisely this

[7/1/22, 10:27:58 PM] Sinjini Columbia: Yeah the old ones are working na, you cannot get a new card now correct?
[7/1/22, 10:34:34 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: An airtel prepaid that doesn't have any international pack will connect to a network in the US and receive incoming messages ?
[7/1/22, 10:35:12 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: If anyone uses VI, the international roaming service is really cheap and works for incoming messages like OTPs
[7/1/22, 10:35:15 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes.
[7/1/22, 10:35:17 PM] Ankit Gupta: Do we stick with the national ones or opt for AT&T or something?
[7/1/22, 10:35:20 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes this too
[7/1/22, 10:35:41 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: So by that logic OTPs should be receivable?
[7/1/22, 10:35:45 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Once you reach the US, try to get a local phone plan and bank account, within the first couple of days
[7/1/22, 10:35:58 PM] Haya Columbia: Again, is your priority speed? Coverage? Cell plans? Roaming?

Deoends on that
[7/1/22, 10:36:02 PM] Haya Columbia: 100%
[7/1/22, 10:40:58 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes. Just keep recharging so the number remains valid and active
[7/1/22, 10:41:25 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: What is this recharge? the lowest talk time?
[7/1/22, 10:41:39 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Alright
[7/1/22, 10:41:43 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yep
[7/1/22, 10:42:28 PM] Haya Columbia: Yh
[7/1/22, 10:49:46 PM] ‪+91 70459 86531‬: I had my prepaid VI phone number on without recharging for almost 11 months and still got texts… Maybe you can go without recharging as long as its on…
[7/1/22, 10:50:08 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Aah that’s nice!
[7/1/22, 10:50:16 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Thanks for the tip :-)
[7/1/22, 10:50:36 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes you can do this too
[7/1/22, 10:50:44 PM] Haya Columbia: But they're changing policies everyday
[7/1/22, 10:50:54 PM] Haya Columbia: So be careful you don't get deactivated
[7/1/22, 10:51:10 PM] Haya Columbia: Happened to me

 It's convenient for those who already have hdfc account
[7/1/22, 11:00:15 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: They are like: the system will generate an offer automatically if you are eligible for an upgrade
[7/1/22, 11:00:16 PM] Haya Columbia: You can apply for higher limit based on you going abroad but i wouldnt recommend it cos if they decline, it'll hurt your CIBIL a lot.
[7/1/22, 11:00:19 PM] Haya Columbia: Yup

[7/1/22, 11:12:31 PM] Adith Columbia: Most people start with a - 1 aka no credit history, and if you're accumulating rapid credit at a rate of >income (or 80% of), that's when your credit drops. But you can only go up from - 1, and it drops only when there's either a soft/hard bureau hit or delinquencies.
[7/2/22, 12:01:54 AM] Haya Columbia: Doesn't matter if you hit your limit as long as you pay back promptly, in full, within the due date.

Might be different if you pay back in part.

But mostly, as long as you keep paying back a good amount (even if not full) and this amount is over the minimum, your score wont be harmed buch
[7/2/22, 12:03:09 AM] Haya Columbia: Listen to Adith about anything banking related, guys. He's a guru with those things.

[7/2/22, 2:53:08 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: List is available over the internet as well

[7/2/22, 2:56:33 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Makes sense. Some concentrations of mech are in TAL
[7/2/22, 2:57:04 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It was MS in Mech. Without decided specialisation
[7/2/22, 2:57:38 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Is comp eng TAL??
[7/2/22, 2:58:12 PM] ‪+91 6202 331 374‬: Some concentrations are.

[7/2/22, 3:16:19 PM] ‪+91 74350 69055‬: You just need assure the officer that you won't be studying the subjects mentioned in that list

[7/2/22, 3:21:26 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: How to do that i just know that the specialisation isnt assigned i would rather said i am undecided
[7/2/22, 3:21:37 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: *say
[7/2/22, 3:27:53 PM] ‪+91 74350 69055‬: From my personal experience:
My concentration is related to energy.
So, I just looked up the subjects related to my field in the TAL.
During my interview the officer after typing something:
Asked me if I'm going to study "High energy density"
Since, I read the TAL i knew that it was one of the subjects mentioned in TAL.
I replied "No"
Still, he asked me again if I'm going to study that subject.
So, I replied that since the subject is mentioned in the TAL i won't be pursuing it.
After this he approved my visa.
[7/2/22, 3:29:01 PM] ‪+91 98665 49935‬: Better not to say undecided go with some concentration that isn't in TAL list, if so !!
[7/2/22, 3:29:54 PM] ‪+91 98665 49935‬: *and say that atleast during interview
[7/2/22, 3:30:42 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Ohkay will do so but that would be lying right??
[7/2/22, 3:30:46 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: 😅😅
[7/2/22, 3:35:27 PM] ‪+91 98665 49935‬: According to what I was told, if chance, avoid TAL courses even during concentration selection and choosing courses, many do the same. But if are highly interested in that, u must decide !!
[7/2/22, 3:38:11 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: But visa will be approved by then already
[7/2/22, 3:39:25 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yeah if you’re interested in that field you should definitely pursue it
[7/2/22, 3:39:52 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: This is only if you’re unsure of what to pursue.
[7/2/22, 3:39:56 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Yeah thats what..like so many ppl are into robotics and AI
[7/2/22, 3:40:02 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yep
[7/2/22, 3:40:15 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Its a TAL sadly
[7/2/22, 3:40:22 PM] ‪+91 98665 49935‬: Exactly
[7/2/22, 3:40:38 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Doesnt matter once you get the visa
[7/2/22, 3:40:46 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Yea
[7/2/22, 3:40:50 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: So many Indians have had successful careers in TAL fields
[7/2/22, 3:41:02 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: For visa i might say other specialisation then
[7/2/22, 3:41:14 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yep
[7/2/22, 3:41:19 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Do your research well
[7/2/22, 3:41:23 PM] ‪+91 74909 84029‬: Even neural nets is TAL like they are hot topics in tech companies
[7/2/22, 3:42:33 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: Yep
[7/2/22, 3:44:30 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: this doesn't make sense :( if you discount neural networks, you're removing an opportunity to study any deep learning course. Deep Learning is all neural nets

Tbf, i mever wanted jio so i never looked into it
[7/3/22, 7:25:31 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Everyone ik in Mumbai from my college switched to airtel
[7/3/22, 7:25:38 PM] Haya Columbia: For international roaming reliability on avreage, vodafone India is best. 
My dad's been using since it was Hutch.
[7/3/22, 7:25:41 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Cause Vodafone was shitty af
[7/3/22, 7:25:43 PM] Haya Columbia: Its cheaper
[7/3/22, 7:25:48 PM] Haya Columbia: But anyway
[7/3/22, 7:25:49 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Spoke to someone in Japan. Vodafone stopped working, so that had to come to India and change to Airtel. So sounds like preferences vary.
[7/3/22, 7:25:59 PM] Haya Columbia: Yes
[7/3/22, 7:26:16 PM] Haya Columbia: But again.
 in NYC, no difference
[7/3/22, 7:26:29 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Maybe for the place ur dad's in worked but as i said in uae vodafone was a complete waste of money
[7/3/22, 7:26:39 PM] Haya Columbia: Oh no
[7/3/22, 7:26:48 PM] Haya Columbia: Telecom in UAE is just 👎
[7/3/22, 7:26:51 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: My mom literally couldn't get any internet
[7/3/22, 7:26:55 PM] Haya Columbia: Im talking for US only
[7/3/22, 7:27:10 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Jio ka kiske saath hai
[7/3/22, 7:27:22 PM] Haya Columbia: ^^
[7/3/22, 7:27:23 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Oh
[7/3/22, 7:27:33 PM] ‪+91 90990 97172‬: Oh okay
[7/3/22, 7:27:49 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: U said international reliability so i thought u meant in general
[7/3/22, 7:27:54 PM] Haya Columbia: They'll likely have a pdf on their international roaming section.
[7/3/22, 7:28:11 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: If u r speaking about only US then idk much
[7/3/22, 7:28:29 PM] Haya Columbia: In general, yes i did mean that but when i was talking about reliability that my dad experienced, i was being specific tot he US.

Sorry, should've been clearer.
[7/3/22, 7:29:42 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Naa its not that. Everyone in my college were from well to do families but the thing was that we couldn't get internet speed above 4-5 mbps
[7/3/22, 7:30:00 PM] Haya Columbia: Oh
[7/3/22, 7:30:02 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Sometimes we couldn't get the network only
[7/3/22, 7:30:11 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: That's y one by one everyone switched
[7/3/22, 7:30:17 PM] Haya Columbia: Youre talking about where
[7/3/22, 7:30:26 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: In Mumbai
[7/3/22, 7:30:29 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Vile parle
[7/3/22, 7:30:38 PM] Haya Columbia: Lmao that has no bearing on intl roaming
[7/3/22, 7:30:46 PM] Haya Columbia: My uk number sucked so bad in uk
[7/3/22, 7:31:06 PM] Haya Columbia: But i get 70 mbps over LTE in europe and 40 in india
[7/3/22, 7:31:09 PM] ‪+91 98665 49935‬: And guys to add a question,
 
What about the provisional degree certificate and the transcripts are u taking to the US as we potentially stay there for next 5 years atleast, or just keeping in home !?
[7/3/22, 7:31:14 PM] Haya Columbia: Contrasting with 5 in london
[7/3/22, 7:31:39 PM] Haya Columbia: Keep all your originals with you
[7/3/22, 7:32:18 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: My point is if they can't provide decent network service in their own Country, its sorta logical to not believe they can do it overseas
[7/3/22, 7:32:25 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: But this
[7/3/22, 7:32:42 PM] Haya Columbia: Again, not how it works. 

Cos here the infra is theirs.


There its just a contract with another company
[7/3/22, 7:32:45 PM] Haya Columbia: Anyway guys
[7/3/22, 7:32:49 PM] Haya Columbia: Dont overthink roaming
[7/3/22, 7:32:57 PM] Haya Columbia: Youre gonna use your indian numbers for MAX 10 days
[7/3/22, 7:33:01 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Yeah
[7/3/22, 7:33:16 PM] Haya Columbia: You can get a PAYG sim for any network ever from a local 7-11 store
[7/3/22, 7:34:19 PM] Haya Columbia: When i was in the US, i paid $52 at a 7-eleven for a large slushee and a Tmobile sim with a 30-day pack included 🤷‍♂️
[7/3/22, 7:35:18 PM] Haya Columbia: So, getting a prepaid number there is super easy (getting a 2yr contract is different for each person so no comment on that)

And theres no need to mess about with international roaming
[7/3/22, 7:35:52 PM] Haya Columbia: (No id or anything needed btw)
[7/3/22, 7:36:20 PM] ‪+91 98665 49935‬: And what's the best telecom provider for NYC in specific and all of US, wrt to connectivity, majority usage and plan fee !?
[7/3/22, 7:36:44 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: And internet speed
[7/3/22, 7:36:54 PM] Haya Columbia: Whatever number you have now, just turn on roaming, maybe add a 7 day pack and get a sim from a local network store or even convenience store and activate it in an hour
[7/3/22, 7:37:11 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: I think we should put this question on ms columbia grp
[7/3/22, 7:37:24 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: So that we could get answers from those living over there
[7/3/22, 7:37:26 PM] Haya Columbia: Again, im trying to explain that there are no such thing as best service providers in ISP, telecom, credit, banking, housing, ANYTHING.
[7/3/22, 7:37:32 PM] Haya Columbia: You should do your own research
[7/3/22, 7:37:37 PM] Haya Columbia: And pick a plan that suits you best
[7/3/22, 7:37:55 PM] Haya Columbia: Differes area to area. Refer to speed maps on each provider's site
[7/3/22, 7:38:03 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Damn
[7/3/22, 7:39:11 PM] Haya Columbia: Biggest ones are:
AT&T
Sprint
T mobile
Virgin
Verizon
[7/3/22, 7:39:25 PM] Haya Columbia: Also, americans call this as "wireless"
[7/3/22, 7:39:35 PM] Haya Columbia: Wifi is broadband
And wireless is mobile phones
[7/3/22, 7:39:51 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: U should conduct a lecture on american terminologies
[7/3/22, 7:40:00 PM] Haya Columbia: So verizon wireless for example, is for cell phones and portable devices

Verizon broadband is for your home
[7/3/22, 7:40:14 PM] Haya Columbia: k.
[7/3/22, 7:40:18 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: How one could accommodate over there when it comes to this type of stuff
[7/3/22, 7:40:31 PM] ‪+91 98665 49935‬: Exactly
[7/3/22, 7:42:16 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: https://www.mintmobile.com
[7/3/22, 7:43:12 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: Looks nice (but they lease from the bug providers) . But no support for Apple Watch if anyone cares about that.
[7/3/22, 8:34:17 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Mint mobile is the cheapest option you can get. They buy spectrum usage from T Mobile, so it’ll be quite good in NYC, but maybe not the best outside city areas in the US
[7/3/22, 8:34:39 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: But if you plan to stay in NYC, Mint is totally fine
[7/3/22, 8:37:25 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: As for the major providers, the most economical way to use them is family plans.
So make a group of 4-5+ people and get one of their unlimited plans, it’ll be worth it

From personal experience, Verizon has worked much better for me than AT&T, I get 5G connectivity everywhere around the Columbia campus

Friends who have used T Mobile have also highly recommended that.
[7/3/22, 9:01:09 PM] ‪+91 99305 72437‬: Thanks
[7/3/22, 10:17:42 PM] Adith Columbia: Hey folks, I've been assigned the henry hudson place - private room/private bath. It's pretty big (7A in the below floor plan).

[7/5/22, 3:30:25 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: If the loan was taken from an NBFC/Bank in the US (requires a guarantor in the US), then the final amount approved comes from the University to the lender.
[7/5/22, 3:31:22 PM] ‪+91 99805 14344‬: So there is some university paperwork related to this. Also, follow up paper work if you have more than anticipated expense and need an increase in uni approved amount.

[7/5/22, 9:40:04 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: It’s the payment confirmation you downloaded from the SEVIS fee payment website
[7/5/22, 9:40:13 PM] ‪+91 99874 44995‬: That itself functions as the receipt

[7/5/22, 9:55:27 PM] ‪+91 93199 73394‬: Hi guys - what could be a reasonable estimate of the living expenses? Would $1800 per month (rent+food+transport)  be a reasonable estimate? Considering living with a roommate and staying maybe an 1 away from campus. Thanks
[7/5/22, 9:56:18 PM] ‪+31 6 47638022‬: yes
[7/5/22, 9:58:29 PM] ‪+91 93199 73394‬: Okay,
[7/5/22, 10:05:07 PM] ‪+91 93199 73394‬: So can we can that for 3 semesters (till graduation) it would look like - 1800 per month x 12 months = 21600 as the cost of living in NYC while attending Columbia . Correct?
[7/5/22, 10:06:15 PM] Ankit Gupta: You can cut down in Winters by eating at soup kitchens
[7/5/22, 10:07:18 PM] Adith Columbia: 25,200 is the estimate given for sps @919319973394 , so that's a fair assumption to go off
[7/5/22, 10:07:39 PM] Ankit Gupta: Sundays can be taken care if you go to a temple/gurudwara 
Free food
[7/5/22, 10:08:18 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: are there any close by? 😂
[7/5/22, 10:08:33 PM] ‪+91 90042 63509‬: Yeah I was gonna say, since you might go out and stuff 25k would give you more wiggle room
[7/5/22, 10:08:38 PM] ‪+91 77340 07718‬: Yess lots of good people and good food :)!!
[7/5/22, 10:08:46 PM] Haya Columbia: Lol.

[7/5/22, 10:10:00 PM] Vighnesh Balaji: peace
[7/5/22, 10:10:08 PM] Ankit Gupta: On Christian holidays go to a church for free brunch
[7/5/22, 10:11:39 PM] ‪+91 93199 73394‬: So 25k for the entire 3 semester program could be reasonable estimate?
[7/5/22, 10:11:46 PM] Disha Khanted Columbia: Yes
[7/5/22, 10:12:09 PM] ‪+91 90042 63509‬: Yepp, it’s a generous estimate
[7/5/22, 10:12:31 PM] ‪+91 73974 65468‬: Do share 😂
[7/5/22, 10:12:43 PM] ‪+91 93199 73394‬: Ok, thank you guys. I appreciate this help
[7/5/22, 10:13:04 PM] ‪+1 (917) 716‑5825‬: Yes, that’s a valid estimate
If you’re interning in the summer outside NYC, you can try to sublet your apartment and earn some money back
[7/5/22, 10:14:17 PM] ‪+91 93199 73394‬: What parts of New York could the rent be on a resonable side?

[7/5/22, 10:16:32 PM] ‪+91 85114 50175‬: are there gurudwaras in NYC?

[7/5/22, 10:16:45 PM] ‪+91 90042 63509‬: You could get studios for $700-800 if you check out Harlem but it’s not a safe neighborhood. So there’s a tradeoff. Some safe neighborhoods close to Columbia are Morningside, West Harlem and Manhattanville, where I’ve seen single rooms as low as $1220
[7/5/22, 10:16:45 PM] Ankit Gupta: There are gurudwaras below central park

[7/5/22, 11:35:26 PM] Haya Columbia: Im resetting this group's link too
[7/5/22, 11:37:00 PM] Ankit Gupta: Yeah it's a prank I guess...the group link was on NEU Grp ..also doxxing is not part of our prank. So you may want to investigate further who is doing that .. maybe someone else as the link is public so we don't know exactly how many grps the invite was spread to 👍🏼👍🏼. But it was no one from NEU group for sure.
[7/5/22, 11:37:29 PM] Ankit Gupta: I doxxed one of them and he felt sorry lmfao

[7/5/22, 11:39:16 PM] Ankit Gupta: Few people who get reject and are in the group do such mischiefs so it was someone at UF as half of our group faced doxxing

[7/5/22, 11:58:22 PM] Haya Columbia: Btw. I think now since we're all fairly acquainted, we should delete the responses forms (the housing ones, the general admitted ones, and a couple others, maybe everything except travel dates)

[7/6/22, 12:18:22 AM] ‪+91 82798 03383‬: Old sheet where anyone outside Columbia could access the data was taken down long back, in the current sheet everyone with Columbia email ID has editor's access, those who want their data to be removed can go ahead and delete but please be careful while deleting so that you don't delete anyone else's response
[7/6/22, 12:19:49 AM] Haya Columbia: Yes but in a gc is much different from in a spreadsheet

[7/6/22, 12:36:15 AM] Haya Columbia: I'd recoomend just copy all info onto a new organisation locked document then delete all the info off the old one, and then just replace the link in the desc here
